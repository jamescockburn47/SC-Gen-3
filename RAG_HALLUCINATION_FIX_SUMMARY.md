# RAG Hallucination Fix Summary

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Your RAG system was producing hallucinated responses with placeholder text instead of extracting real information from documents. The problematic output included:

- `[OR: an individual or entity named in the documents]`
- `[Source 1, Page XX]`
- `[DATE]`
- Template-like responses instead of actual document content

## 🔍 Root Causes Found

1. **Duplicate Model Configuration**: The multi-agent orchestrator had `deepseek-llm:7b` listed twice, causing incorrect task assignments
2. **Weak Prompt Instructions**: Prompts didn't enforce strict document extraction
3. **No Template Prevention**: No safeguards against placeholder/template responses
4. **Insufficient Validation**: No checks that models were actually citing real document content

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Anti-Hallucination RAG Interface
**File**: `quick_rag_fix.py`
- Strict prompting that prevents placeholder responses
- Real-time hallucination detection
- Content validation before sending to models
- Temperature set to 0.0 for deterministic responses

### 2. Fixed Multi-Agent Orchestrator
**File**: `multi_agent_rag_orchestrator.py`
- Removed duplicate model entries
- Updated prompts to enforce document-only extraction
- Added strict citation requirements
- Lowered temperature to prevent creative responses

### 3. Added Test Framework
**File**: `test_rag_hallucination_fix.py`
- Comprehensive testing for hallucination patterns
- Multi-model validation
- Detailed debugging output

### 4. Emergency Disable Option
**File**: `disable_multiagent_rag.py`
- Temporarily disable problematic multi-agent system
- Fallback to reliable single-agent approach
- Easy restore when fixes are verified

## 🛠️ How to Use the Fixes

### Quick Fix (Recommended for immediate use)
```bash
# Test the anti-hallucination system
python3 test_rag_hallucination_fix.py

# Or test a specific query
python3 test_rag_hallucination_fix.py "What is the case number?" phi3:latest
```

### Use the Anti-Hallucination Interface
```python
# In your Streamlit app
from quick_rag_fix import render_simple_rag_ui

# Add this to your app
render_simple_rag_ui()
```

### Disable Multi-Agent System (if issues persist)
```bash
# Disable the problematic multi-agent system
python3 disable_multiagent_rag.py disable

# Check status
python3 disable_multiagent_rag.py status

# Restore when ready
python3 disable_multiagent_rag.py restore
```

## 🔧 Key Improvements

### New Strict Prompting
```
You are a document analysis assistant. You MUST ONLY use information from the provided documents below.

STRICT RULES:
- Only state facts that are explicitly written in the documents
- If information is not in the documents, say "This information is not provided in the documents"
- Do NOT use placeholder text like "[DATE]" or "[Source X, Page XX]"
- Quote directly from documents when possible
```

### Hallucination Detection
The system now automatically flags responses containing:
- Placeholder patterns: `[OR:`, `[DATE]`, `Page XX`
- Uncertain language: "I think", "probably", "might be"
- Template indicators

### Content Validation
- Ensures document chunks have meaningful content (>20 characters)
- Validates that sources actually contain text
- Checks citation format compliance

## 📊 Testing Results

Run the test script to verify fixes work:
```bash
python3 test_rag_hallucination_fix.py
```

Expected output:
- ✅ No problematic patterns detected
- Real document citations instead of placeholders
- Actual extracted content instead of templates

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes**: Run the test script with your documents
2. **Use anti-hallucination interface**: Switch to `quick_rag_fix.py` for reliable results
3. **Monitor responses**: Watch for any remaining hallucination indicators
4. **Re-enable multi-agent**: Once confident in the fixes, restore the multi-agent system

## ⚠️ Prevention Guidelines

To prevent future hallucination issues:

1. **Always use strict prompting** that explicitly forbids placeholder text
2. **Set temperature to 0.0** for document extraction tasks
3. **Validate document content** before sending to models
4. **Test with multiple models** to identify patterns
5. **Monitor for template language** in responses

## 🔄 Reverting Changes

If you need to revert to the original system:
```bash
# Restore original multi-agent system
python3 disable_multiagent_rag.py restore

# The original files are backed up with .backup extension
```

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### If hallucinations persist:
1. Check that documents are properly loaded: `python3 test_rag_hallucination_fix.py`
2. Use the emergency disable: `python3 disable_multiagent_rag.py disable`
3. Test with single queries: `python3 test_rag_hallucination_fix.py "your question"`

### If no documents found:
1. Ensure documents are uploaded to the system
2. Check the matter ID matches your document collection
3. Verify vector database is properly created

The fixes specifically target the template/placeholder response issue you experienced. The system should now extract only real, factual information from your documents instead of generating placeholder text.
