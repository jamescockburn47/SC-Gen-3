Mr Ab aris relies on the full content of the UCL Undergraduate Prospectus es for the academic year s 2018 -19 and 2019 -20 as material relevant to the construction of the Abaris Contract, being the Prospectus relevant to the academic year of the commencement of his studies and the Prospectus for the subsequent academic year (which was published some 18 months ahead). Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Mr Abaris relies in particular on the following matters: a. Both Prospectuses contained photographs o f UCL\u2019s campus and of students receiving tuition in person and enjoying physical access to UCL\u2019s facilities, such as libraries. b. Both Prospectus es emphasised the importance to the student experience of UCL \u2019s location in London and its on -site or nearby fac ilities . For example , in the 2018 -19 Prospectus : \u201cWe\u2019re based in the heart of London \u2013 giving you outstanding academic, professional and social benefits \u201d; \u201cUCL \u2019s Bloomsbury campus has various resources to make your studies enjoyable and effective as well as enabling you to make the most of your free time.

Both Prospectuses suggested that teaching would take place in person. For example: i. They contained images of students studying and being taught on campus and of on -site teaching facilities. The sections on \u201c Medicine \u201d (in the 2018 - 19 Prospectus) and \u201cMedicine and Allied Subjects \u201d (in the 2019 -20 Prospectus) displayed images of students bei ng taught in labs and classrooms. ii. They contained sections on open days . The 2018 -19 Prospectus stated these were \u201c A great opportunity to explore the university and our world -class facilities \u201d. The 2019 -20 Prospectus stated \u201cDiscover UCL for yourself \u2013 Docusign Envelope ID: D98405F7-BAAC-4075-AF3F-6F9EFC09A860 4 There\u2019s always something exciting going on at UCL, and our central London location makes finding us easy .\u201d iii.

The Royal Free campus in Hampstead is the site of the Royal Free Hospital. The Whittington campus in Archway is the site of the newly refurbished Whittington Hospital, set to become one of the country\u2019s first Integrated Care Organisations. Clinical teaching also takes place in many other prestigious Foundation Trusts, Associated University Hospitals, District General Hospitals, and in a range of general practice and com munity settings .\u201d 16. In the premises and on the true construction of the Tuition Clause and Facilities Clause in the Abaris Contract, UCL owed a contractual duty to Mr Abaris to provide him with (i) in - person, campus -based tuition and (ii) physical access to facilities to support his learning. Without prejudice to the foregoing, UCL and Mr Abaris intended and expected those terms to have such a meaning. 17. Alternatively, it was an implied term of the Abaris Contract that UCL would provide Mr Abaris with in -perso n, campus -based tuition and physical access to facilities to support Mr Abari s\u2019 learning. Such a term was implied on grounds that it was obvious. 18. The Abaris Contract did not contain terms specifying the number of hours of tuition which would be provided to Mr Abaris . Such information, provided by UCL after the Abaris Contract was entered into, is pleaded below (to the extent possible) for the purposes of identifying the extent of UCL\u2019s breaches and quantifying Mr Abaris\u2019 claim .

The provision by UCL described in paragraph 13 above was consistent with the way in which the majority of universities in the UK had, until Ma rch 2020, provided tuition and related services. Such provision was distinct in both respects from \u201c distance learning \u201d offered by, for example, The Open University whose qualifications are (according to its website) priced at \u201c two- thirds of the cost [to a UK student] of an equivalent qualification offered at a campus -based university \u201d. 15.

It announced on its website: \u201cDue to social distancing requirements, all your Term One core teaching will take place online, including lectures, tutorials, seminars and assessments. By \u2018core teaching\u2019 we mean everything you need to learn to complete the module successfully. There will be highly interactive sessions in real time, as well as engaging learning activities designed so you can study at your own pace and in your own time zone. We are also making sure that dissertations and major projects can be carried out online. \u2026Campus will be open, as will UCL libraries, UCL Careers, the Student Centre and Students\u2019 Union UCL spaces. The physical access you will have to these facilities and social spaces will be severely restricted in Term One, but you will have full online access to our services. Your safety is our priority and in Term One, opportunities to join us on campus will be significantly reduced. \u2026Physical access to study spaces, common rooms, libr aries and social spaces will also be severely restricted in Term One, but you will have full online access to our services. \u201d 40. On 9 November 2020, the UCL website published \u201c An important message about your UCL Education in Terms Two and Three 2020 -21\u201d. The message stated that teaching and assessment in Terms Two and Three (11 January to 11 June 2021) would be similar to Term One, in that \u201call core teaching and assessment will be online (by core teaching, we mean everything you need to learn to complete the m odule successfully) \u201d. 41. On 2 January 2021, the UCL website published a message from the Provost, Professor Michael Arthur, and incoming Provost Dr Michael Spence, with information for new and returning students for Term Two, due to commence on 11 January 2021. The message stated that UCL was moving \u201call teaching and other face -to-face, in -person activities on -line from the start of term until the end of reading week. There will be no in-person teaching on 15 campus until Monday 22 February, at the earliest (exc ept for a small number of exempt subjects, see below). \u201d The message strongly advised students not to plan to come to campus until reading week (which commenced on 15 February 2021) at the earliest. 42. On 29 January 2021, the UCL website published a further message from the Provost, Dr Spence, which stated that all teaching and other face -to-face activities would remain online for the remainder of Term Two (until 26 March 2021), except for a small number of exempt courses. 43. On 8 February 2021, the UCL website published an announcement from the Vice Provost, Professor Anthony Smith, concerning \u201c COVID -mitigation measures for 2020 -21 exams and assessments \u201d. The announcement acknowledged that \u201cyou have not had access to facilities such as the library in the normal way\u201d and stated that staff would mark students\u2019 work taking into account the challenges they had faced, giving as an example, \u201cthis might mean that you have drawn examples from a narrower range of reference sources than you would have done in a normal year with full access to all library facilities. \u201d 44. For the whole of the academic year 2020 -21, in line with the announcements referred to at paragraphs 39, 40, and 41 to 42 above: a. UCL did not provide the Claimants with in -person, campus -based tuition. All core teaching and assessment were provided online only (except for a small number of exempt courses); and",

For the whole of the academic year 2020 -21, in line with the announcements referred to at paragraphs 39, 40, and 41 to 42 above: a. UCL did not provide the Claimants with in -person, campus -based tuition. All core teaching and assessment were provided online only (except for a small number of exempt courses); and b. While the UCL campus was open, the Claimants\u2019 physical access to UCL\u2019s facilities was severely restricted. For example, many libraries were completely closed from January to April 2021. Insofar as the Claimants are presently able, the extent of the closures in respect of each of UCL\u2019 s libraries is particularised in Appendix 3. When open, the libraries often operated on a restricted basis, for example by (a) offering a \u201cclick and collect\u201d service only, (b) restricting the number of available study spaces, and/or (c) restricting the num ber of hours for 16 which students could book study spaces. The Claimants reserve the right to plead further particulars of the restrictions on physical access to UCL\u2019s facilities following disclosure. Academic year 2021 -22 45. In the academic year 2021 -22, a material proportion of the teaching at UCL, particularly large group teaching , was provided online only. The Claimants reserve the right to plead further particulars of the extent of such online teaching following disclosure. Tuition Fees during Covid -19 46. UCL charged and collected Tuition Fees in full throughout the Covid -19 pandemic. The Learning Opportunities Fund did not cover disruption caused by Covid -19. UCL did not offer any Tuition Fee reduction or rebate to students to compensate them for the loss of in -person tuition and full, physical access to the facilities designed to support students\u2019 learning. Breaches of contract 47. In performance of the Contracts, each Claimant paid Tuition Fees in the full amount charged by UCL (or, upon the Claimant undert aking liabilities to the Student Loans Company, such Tuition Fees were paid on the Claimant\u2019s behalf). Insofar as the Claimants are presently able, Appendix 2 specifies whether each student is/was a UK/ EU student or an overseas student, and the total amou nt of Tuition Fees paid by or on behalf of each Claimant. 48. UCL failed to provide in -person, campus -based tuition and/or physical access to facilities to support the Claimants\u2019 learning on at least the following occasions: a. In the academic year 2017 -18, UCL failed to provide teaching on 14 teaching days (out of 105 teaching days \u2013 \u2018teaching days\u2019 excludes 17 reading week and Term Three, during which no teaching was scheduled). b. In the academic year 2019 -2020, UCL failed to provide teaching on 20 teaching days (out of 105 teaching days \u2013 \u2018teaching days\u2019 excludes reading week and Term Three, during which no teaching was scheduled). c. In the academic year 2021 -22, UCL failed to provide teaching on 13 teaching days (out of 105 teaching days \u2013 \u2018teaching days\u2019 exclude s reading week and Term Three, during which no teaching was scheduled). d. In Term Two of the academic year 2019 -20, between 16 March and 27 March 2020, UCL failed to provide in -person teaching, and instead cancelled teaching or provided online teaching. e. In Term Three of the academic year 2019 -20, between 27 April and 12 June 2020, UCL failed to provide in-person teaching, and instead provided online teaching. f.

For the entirety of the academic year 2020 -21, UCL failed to provide physical access to its facilities to support students\u2019 learning (including, but not limited to libraries and labora tories); they were either closed or access to them was severely restricted. 18 i. In the academic year 2021 -22, UCL failed to provide in -person teaching, in that most large group teaching was held online only. 49. Insofar as the Claimants are presently able, the e xtent to which the failures identified at paragraph 48 above applied to each Claimant is particularised in Appendix 2. 50. The failures identified in paragraph 48 above amounted to breaches of the Contracts as follows: a. In relation to Claimants who contracted with UCL on the Standard Terms referred to in paragraph 7 above (namely, undergraduate and graduates commencing in 2015 -16, 2016 -17 and 2017 -18), UCL\u2019s failures am ounted to a breach of clauses 7.3(1) and 7.9(1) of the Standard Terms; b.

Alternatively, in relation to all Claimants, UCL\u2019s failures amounted to a breach of the implied term to provide in -person, campus -based tuition and physical access to facilities to support the Claimants\u2019 learning. Causation and Loss 51. By reason of the aforesaid breaches of contract, each Claimant has suffered loss and damage, in that the tuition and related services for which the Claimants contracted have not been provided, alternatively th ey have been only partially provided, or have been provided in a materially different form to that which was promised. 52. The Claimants seek damages, in an amount to be quantified, representing the difference between (a) the market value of the services prom ised and (b) the market value of the services provided. In particular: a. Damages in respect of UCL\u2019s failures pleaded in paragraphs 48.a,",

And off the top of my head that I think that's what I could think of. 0:18 So does that sound like some good reason? I mean, so they can access to cadavers. That that quite unusual then that was that sort of particular element available that you see other wasn't available elsewhere was it is that your point that sort of hands on access? Elyas Abaris 0:37 Yeah. So it it is available in a few other universities, but it is quite rare. Most universities don't do that. They don't let you actually dissect yourself. 0:48 Yeah. Elyas Abaris 0:49 Whereas UCL is one of the few universities that do that you do that, get that hands on approach. 0:58 The previous interview that you're a London resident, right? You're born in Bondbrand, London, I think. Did you? Elyas Abaris 1:03 Yes, that's right. 1:04 Yeah. So what? What I was wondering was why it was UCL. There are other good universities in London and why that do Madison? And and why it was UCL in particular, but that was. Really helpful. Yeah. Sounds like you've addressed that, yeah. And we're staying in London. Important to you? Or is it just? It wouldn't have been decisive if you found a uni elsewhere. That. Elyas Abaris 1:28 I think I mean, I had gotten into other universities elsewhere. I think it's just, I couldn't imagine myself anywhere else than in London. I think so that it did play a key part as well in deciding. 1:42 I know what you mean, don't worry. Right. And before you registered your course with UCL, did you sort of do anything in terms of visiting the campus or attending open day? Or did you know anybody who previously attended UCL that you were speaking to at the time? Elyas Abaris 2:10 So. I mean, before even getting to the sort of the application period. I was part of a widening participation scheme run by UCL. For yeah, so. So my sort of contact with UCL started quite far back. Even before then, I'd had work experience at Uclh. And also work experience in AUC or laboratory in the Institute of Child Health. So sort of it does. I've had quite a few experiences with UCL before even getting to that point. And then after I did get an offer, I think I did attend an open day beforehand and then I attended an offer holders day afterwards as well. 3:00 Yeah. And. When you at the point of, I believe you accepted your offer around February 2018. And it seems a bit of a silly question to ask, but when you're accepted. Your offer to study at UCL at that point, what what sort of format did you expect the teaching to take and how would you expect? How did you expect the teaching to be delivered? Elyas Abaris 3:35 So I think I knew that UCL. So there's I think there's three different sort of methodologies that medical school sort of approach teaching in. And I think UCL was, I'm struggling to remember from when I was applying, but I think UCL had sort of a more. Merged approach in which you have your face",

Merged approach in which you have your face to face lectures, but they also sort of interweave it with. Sort of hands on experience as well. So I expected to have a mix of those lectures and also a lot of sort of hands on time in the lab, in the hospital sort of supplement the lectures. 4:17 Yeah. Elyas Abaris 4:17 Whereas I think a lot of there's a lot of unis where it's sort of split, you have all your lectures in the first few years and then afterwards you have only clinical time and no lectures at all, whereas you see all had sort of that merged format and it's sort of supposed to carry on like that throughout the six years. 4:38 And. Between, well, when you started your Co, op's between in 2018, that was and just before COVID March 2020. What format did your teaching take? Was that the format that you expected? To have. Elyas Abaris 4:58 Yeah, so I think. 5:01 Merged teaching that you've mentioned. Elyas Abaris 5:01 Yeah. So I think in the first year and three months. It pre COVID it's sort of stuck to that format. It was, you know, experiences in hospital were quite rare because it was quite early on. But I sort of definitely a lot of experience in the labs whether that be the anatomy lab or. Sort of the the our problem based learning labs where we sort of do some sort of experiments and things like that. So that's what it was for the first year and three months. That I think around. February, maybe March. I think when all of this with COVID started to. Rear its head. It was switched to, you know, fully online lectures only. There were there weren't any sort of opportunities to come in and do any of this face to face. Hands on learning at all. 6:00 So in other words, the form of teaching and delivery method that was important to you and you that you contracted for evaporate it essentially and it was replaced with something else completely different. Which was not what you. Elyas Abaris 6:13 Yeah. 6:13 Expected back in 2018. Elyas Abaris 6:16 Yeah. 6:17 Yeah, that make, I mean that makes sense, obviously. I mean part of part of the other team, I said this at the beginning. You might remember when we put together or when you're when your individual particulars claim were put together. It referred to the prospectus that you see undergraduate prospectus and the elements that spectus that talked about medical students as well. And again, there's this sort of butting heads with UCL because on one hand we say we provide extracts that say things like. You'll you'll be in the heart of London and you'll you'll get outstanding academic pressure on social Benefits, campus benefits, all you need to fulfil your potential is here at the heart of one capital world's great capital cities, museums, collections you mentioned museums. Other various photos that we talk about in this respect. Which they then seek in in response to this, to downplay, say, well, it's just a couple",

It doesn't mean anything. One can't reasonably infer from that that you could get in person teaching. Elyas Abaris 7:13 Yeah. 7:20 Save, of course, we say for the fact that everybody gave conclusive teaching until COVID and that's that's the differentiating factor. But is that is that you're sorry to take it slightly out of secrets, but when you're in the lead up to starting, I'm assuming that. You're, you know, part of what you're anticipating was based on what you what you had been told would happen or what you know, you could look at online prospectus or a ******** prospectus and see these things. And it wouldn't have occurred to you that. You may be. You may get teaching some completely other way. Why? Or it was even open to UCL to say, hey, you've seen the prospectus. You have certain expectation as to what you're going to get here, but guess what we're going to do the whole thing online starting in 2018. I mean that's that's not what you signed up for is really what I'm saying in that way. Elyas Abaris 8:09 Yeah. 8:11 Yeah. Elyas Abaris 8:12 Yeah, absolutely. I mean or in the lead up to sort of starting at UCL and even before sort of accepting my offer. You know, you're starting university, you're entering a new phase of your life, you're really excited, you're searching up all these prospectuses and even, you know, those images which they say aren't important. You know, you do look at these things and you build up this image in your head as well of sort of what it's going to be for you. 8:31 Yes. Elyas Abaris 8:38 You know when you're in these locations and you know, doing these things. And you know, if they weren't relevant, why would they be included in the prospects just to begin with? 8:44 Yeah. Well said. Well said. Absolutely. And that, and that's one of the points we take, I mean and you know another way of putting it and sadly it's a very long time ago for me. But at the time that you start your undergraduate degree, it is it's sort of a first step into adulthood, but it's it's that's the most significant step you've taken. At that stage of your life, I don't know. I don't know if that's a bit sort of melodramatic, but I don't know if you know what I mean by that, because everything associated with it is, is sort of stepping away from a school environment almost from childhood into an independent adult environment, which, which is, which is, which is all about independent learning, of course. But independent learning and taking a step towards a career I don't. I mean, for me it was a massive deal and I'm. I'm I'm. Guessing the T-shirt was for you, and I'm sure it was les for you as well. But what's in your mouth? But that's just my recollection of it and. Elyas Abaris 9:34 Yeah. 9:39 And that's why it doesn't really sit",

Elyas Abaris 9:34 Yeah. 9:39 And that's why it doesn't really sit well for UCL to downplay these things, as you say, because they're huge, hugely significant at the time. Elyas Abaris 9:42 Yeah. 9:47 OK. Yeah. Elyas Abaris 9:48 Yeah, I'd say The thing is, especially when you're, like you said, you're transitioning to this new sort of period of your life and it's all sort of quite daunting and quite scary because you don't know what to expect. You've never been through it before. You sort of use the information that you have sort of prepare yourself for what to expect. And so at least some things won't shock you and some things won't stress you out. So. So you know, you build up this image of what to expect and how you're going to deal with whatever problems arise and things like that. And when everything takes a complete turn and it's, you know, you're already dealing with, living on your own for the first time and all of this, you expect, at least, you know, the image you had of university life to be constant. And when that completely changes, you know, you're like, oh, you know, I'm I'm only a new adult and I'm have. Everything's been turned on its heads, you know, and. 10:32 Yeah. Elyas Abaris 10:39 Yeah. 10:40 It's a lot to deal with. I mean, it had the prospectors been. 100 blank pages saying we can't tell you what you're going. To get so. I think you probably want to take a different view about signing up, but yeah, no, I really hear. What? You're saying, OK, I'll be quiet. So this is so we're kind of at the point where covid's, you know, people are just sort of. You. Know finding out what's happening about COVID and things are starting to change for you and you mentioned that things pretty much. Went exclusively online quite quickly in March and just generally on the on the facility. And sorry to go back a little bit, but between just before COVID. Presumably. You had access to the facilities that required you to effectively, you know, study your course and would is that just limited to labs or was there anything else that you used like labs and libraries or was there anything? Medicine specific that you used a lot during that time prior to COVID. Elyas Abaris 11:55 So I'd say I think in sort of preparation for our final exams in. First year and 2nd year I mean The thing is we also had access to the Clinical Skills Lab in which you know, we'd practise things like taking blood pressure and things like that. The only thing is is that when we had our second year final exams, they scrapped the practical portion of our exams, so I wouldn't say that was particularly particularly needed. At that time, although it did mean that because we lacked that sort of practise in second year and 3rd year is sort of a year out of medicine. When you do get to those fourth year exams and it's the first practical exams that really matter and are really actually quite",

When you do get to those fourth year exams and it's the first practical exams that really matter and are really actually quite difficult, you have, we I we hadn't had any sort of practical experience since our first year. And I think that was quite a difficult transition because we'd had absolutely nowhere to practise until then. And I mean. I think it might be quite relevant to say that's also the only year of medicine where I had to retake my practical exam. So the actual sort of knowledge the written portion was fine. I'd passed that completely fine, but the practical bit I had to reset. And maybe if I'd had access to sort of those labs going, you know, second, third year things would have been better, but. 13:25 Yes. Can I ask is it? Suggested by UCL. In their individual defence to your individual particular claims. Was subject to supervision and I just and that might be right, but I just want to understand a little bit. I mean as in if you wanted to to do something in a lab, what do I mean revision might not be the best way of describing it, but just practise a particular skill or spend some time there working on something. Were you able to do that? Or did that always have to be done as part of? A practical session with a supervisor. How did that? How did that work? Elyas Abaris 14:15 So. In terms of. I mean anatomy Labs, for example. So someone always had to be there. In terms of sort of experimentation and things like that, I guess someone also always had to be there. In terms of clinical skills, someone didn't have to be there, but they had to sort of book us in for sessions, where the things would be available where it would have to be set up beforehand. So for the Clinical Skills lab. We wouldn't need a supervisor per SE. There the whole time, they just need to set up things beforehand. In my third year, so the year that wasn't medicine based, it was sort of much more science, you know, specifically based. Where I had that project that was, you know, supposed to be 100% lab based. I think one of the key reasons that's one of the key things that stops me from being able to go to the lab was the fact that I needed supervision. And my supervisor for my project was someone who I can't remember the term for it, but he was more at risk because of COVID so he wasn't able to come in more than sort of once or twice. He was shielding. I can't remember this. Yeah. 15:42 Yeah, that's what they used to call it, yeah. I. See and they couldn't find somebody else. To sort of step in for him in his absence. Elyas Abaris 15:51 No, not really. 15:55 Did they try or did they just say it's unfortunate that your supervisor's shielding, and that's just the way it is for the? Elyas Abaris 16:02 So I think at one point they did suggest I have a PhD student. One of my supervisor's PhD students attempt to supervise me in the lab,",

Elyas Abaris 16:02 So I think at one point they did suggest I have a PhD student. One of my supervisor's PhD students attempt to supervise me in the lab, and I went once I tried it out once, but this is someone who has their own things that they're dealing with. He's doing his own research. He doesn't know anything about what I'm doing, and you know he's. 16:25 Yeah. Elyas Abaris 16:28 He's there to make sure I don't cause a fire, but at the end of the day, he's not actually supervising my project or know anything about it, so sort of help me. Do anything. That's all. 16:38 Got it. Elyas Abaris 16:40 And in terms of raising any sort of concerns about that, it was very difficult at the time because we were going through course directors. I think the previous course director at the time had been suspended. We didn't have one for a while, then we had one who wasn't really up to date on what was happening. 17:04 That's helpful. I mean going back. To the point you made. A clinical skill, a clinical skills lab session not requiring supervision per SE, but instead requiring a. Elyas Abaris 17:11 Yep. 17:15 Set up I. Think I think you mentioned earlier that an example of clinical skill might be, you know, learning to to take blood pressure or something like that, but generally. Elyas Abaris 17:22 Yep. 17:25 Is that something you? You wanted to do or did do a lot go to the lab for these sort of clinical skills sessions. So was that quite uncommon? Was it something you would have done more? I'm thinking about this this period where you would be denied lab access effectively, but their cases where you could only have had it with supervision. But you've now explained the position is not quite that. It's not quite that stark and you could have used it for clinical skills. Is that something you? Elyas Abaris 17:42 Yeah. 17:54 Would have done or. Did seek to do or was a big part of the way you approached? Your course or. Or or was it not so much? Elyas Abaris 18:01 I mean absolutely, I think it is definitely something that I would have done because I think I mean these practical skills are always going to be important and they're assessed in almost every single year. And you know, I I think in fourth year when sort of COVID was still going on, but they've sort of relaxed it a bit. We were allowed access to these clinical skills labs, but it would be sort of you know minimum number of people in there at a time. And yeah, we wouldn't have any supervisors in there. They, they they could sort of. 18:23 Yeah. Elyas Abaris 18:35 You could request someone to come and help you out if you didn't know how to do something, but it would just be us, you know, with these mannequins, with these models or each other just practising. And that wasn't even an option in second year. 18:52 That's very helpful. And in relation to your, the clinical science module specifically. Elyas Abaris 19:01 Mm hmm. 19:02 Is is it by nature?

Is it a practical module that requires sort of access to labs and stuff? Because the reason why I ask is that UCL stayed that this is this module was more of a library based project as they put it and. As such that they don't, it's not required to collect data in a laboratory. I don't know what your thoughts are on that. Elyas Abaris 19:31 So I'd actually submitted evidence to refute this. So they'd given us a list of projects to pick from, and it was clearly sort of written whether each project would be library based or whether it be laboratory based. And I'd specifically picked. A research project that was laboratory based and you know, it was written in two parts. It was it was written 1st that it was laboratory laboratory based and that the main campus, the main campus for it would be the UCL protein crystallography laboratory laboratory, you know. It was, it was pretty clear cut to me. And I wanted something that was fully lab based. 20:18 And and is this the the project that? You. Received a 2 month an extension. A short period of extension. I don't know if you recall. Elyas Abaris 20:30 Yeah. 20:32 I thought OK and and during that time when you received the extension. Did you get access to the labs? Do you recall whether you got access? Elyas Abaris 20:44 So The thing is, the only reason we got that extension was had nothing to do with COVID. It was our entire sort of cohort, I think, of about 25 students in clinical sciences. And the reason why we've gotten it was because of the problems with the course director where we were going between course directors, they were replacing the old one with a new one and we had a gap where we had absolutely no guidance or sort of no help with what direction. To take our projects in. No other sort of third year courses had this extension. It was only us specifically because of that course director problem. And the at that point the extension sort of really only served to help us with writing our theses. I don't think it gave me any sort of extra lap time and it wouldn't have made a difference anyway because my supervisor was shielding and you know, could only go in once a month. 21:50 It's interesting you say that because in the defence UCLOS seek credit for this two-month extension, so they were they were doing you a favour, but it does sound quite quite bright. Basically what you said. I am I'm wondering whether it might be helpful to take you to a couple of documents. In. In disclosure, and it might help assist with refreshing your memory. Because it's five years ago now, we're talking about. Going to share my screen. And let me know if you can. Davis. So it's like. OK. 8. Can you see that?

Yes, sending an. About the situation about the COVID situation. Page and let's see. OK. And they're saying we're writing to, writing to you with an update about coronavirus and how it might affect you as a UCL student. And it specifically mentions that we know many of you are very concerned about your classes and assessment. And I suppose it's the general question is. Did you provide feedback both at the time? To lecturers or amongst students or. Forums that you might have your student group forums and stuff. Did you sort of voice any concerns that you had in particular about? How the teacher at the format of teaching was going to change as well as any restrictions on facilities that that might occur as a result of COVID. Elyas Abaris 25:47 So I think for the first five years I was at UCL, they we had a feedback portal or where we could sort of send questions or concerns and things like that, that we wanted the medical school to address. And I mean, I alongside many other students, sort of raised our concerns about this because we were all quite worried about sort of the content contents of the teaching. And sort of the format of our exams and things like that. Especially because the format of our exams wasn't confirmed until I think just a few weeks before our final exams. So I was definitely part of the majority who was voicing their concerns on that portal that we had. Which I think they've now gotten rid of. I imagine because we were too vocal. 26:46 Yeah, yeah. And were these, did you feel like they were being adequately addressed your your concerns? Elyas Abaris 26:58 I The thing is, no, not really. I we've always thought that they were quite dismissive about our sort of worries and we'd often get people posting the same thing again and again and again because UCL would just sort of close the topic and say, yeah, an announcement will come soon. An announcement will come soon or we've already addressed this. The answer is not going to change or, you know, things in a similar vein. 27:25 I see I. Was there is the the forum that you mentioned? Is that different to the students complaints process? Elyas Abaris 27:36 So it's specific to the medical school we had sort of our own feedback slash Question board. The name I really can't remember. I trying to log into my UCL account to check. 27:53 Do you still have access to that? Elyas Abaris 27:55 My e-mail. 27:58 Yeah. So all that the the feedback platform.

Which I think that's. Harsh so. Yeah. Yep. So. This is this is. The 9th of June and this is from actually. This is from Marie Algan. I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly. Elyas Abaris 28:55 Yeah. 28:57 Sent on behalf of Doctor Morgan who's who at this stage. Maybe it's Marshall Morgan. I'm thinking of was the course director for the clinical sciences. And I know you've said that there's a bit of revolving door, of course directors, but at this stage it's this. Elyas Abaris 29:10 Yes. 29:11 And I was quite interested, she says. The issue that some very well, he must be really concerned about plans for next year, even the issues arising from the current pandemic. And then I'm just interested in this sentence, really among others, but this one in particular. I'm also very aware of the mixed messages you're receiving from various quarters and the anxiety that this must be reducing. Now, I wondered whether this meant, and you may not recall specifically, but you may have some recollection. Whether you were being told different things by different people at UCL about what to expect in terms of course delivery. How long it would be that you'd have to put up with online tuition? What the position was on access to facilities because you know it's a little bit vague. This is, as in it's in that it sends mixed messages from various quarters. I don't really know what that means, but I'm inferring that it means various quarters within UCL, but. This firstly does this particular document ring any bells? It may not, but but on the general question of whether you've been told one thing by one person that you see another thing by somebody else does that. Was that your? Does that reflect your experience? Elyas Abaris 30:21 I mean, yes, I'd say so, because UCL was sort of quite adamant that we would only have sort of this online teaching. There wouldn't be any sort of face to face experiences, but then we'd get the course director telling us that there's going to be set periods of face to face teaching with restrictions in place, but that she would be able to also get us time in the hospitals, which in the end didn't happen, although we did get some face to face teaching. So that was quite a mixed bag. Of information and I think at one point I did e-mail to sort of seek further clarification and I think I was just told to be patient. 31:06 No idea. Not ideal. So and that must have been, I imagine, pretty confusing. I mean one of. The one. Of the things we we hate as people is uncertainty and it sounds like this was just generating uncertainty because you didn't really know who to believe was that. Was that your experience of it? So you might have your votes boosted. By one person. And then dashed by another. That is that fair description of the experience at the time.",

Elyas Abaris 31:33 Yeah, I'd say so because especially when you've sort of finally gotten into the swing of things and sort of worked your way around the structure of the university only to be told that, oh, you might have this, you might have this, your course starts in, you know, a month. We still don't know how it's going to proceed. You know, it's not very helpful, especially when it's a completely different thing than what you've been used to for the past two years. It's completely. It's not medicine anymore. It's, you know, clinical sciences. It's something different. And you know, it's it's a big change and what you thought was going to be the case, especially when you picked it specifically because we had to pick our third year course I think in the second year and I'd pick clinical sciences specifically because it was going to be hands on, it was going to give me a chance to work on my clinical skills, the clinical skills that I hadn't been able to practise in seconds here. 32:33 Yeah. Elyas Abaris 32:33 The you know then. Be met with such uncertainty and also in the end to not get a chance to practise those clinical skills at all. In the end, even though I picked clinical sciences. It was supposed to be. Yeah, it was supposed to be the bridge between my second and 4th year. 32:47 Yeah. Helpful. And. Sort of going going back to the purely online format which. You were being told. It would. Your teaching would transition into. I am going to slide back to this e-mail. And it's just at the beginning of COVID in March 2020, and it talks specifically about GDC cancer lectures. And. It talks about how your lectures would now be delivered via Electro casts and they would use last year's lectures to deliver that content to you, I suppose. Did you find that? Elyas Abaris 33:48 Yep. 33:51 That. What was being delivered those online modules on lecture casts were were they adequate? Did it sufficiently cover what you intended to learn for that year, or did you find them deficient? Elyas Abaris 34:06 The thing is. Any sort of gaps in knowledge didn't make themselves apparent until much later on, so I'd say until fourth year, because like they've mentioned, anything where it's not clear they wouldn't include in our final exam, meaning that it was sort of a terrible gauge of the actual level of your knowledge competitive compared to the curriculum. Meaning you know it sort of gave you this false sense of security. Especially considering the exams were open book online 24 hour exams where even if you didn't know something you were completely allowed to just do your own research. It meant that, you know, in a fourth year after you've had this one year gap from medicine and it's just assumed that you have this scientific knowledge from first and 2nd year. It does make things quite difficult and you realise that you didn't know some of the things you thought you knew because. You",

It does make things quite difficult and you realise that you didn't know some of the things you thought you knew because. You know, it was just removed from the assessment because it was removed from Electro cost because it wasn't of good enough quality. 35:15 I don't know if you appreciate that, but that's that's really interesting. So I think what you're saying is that the exam content was narrowed so as to conform with the content of lecture casts. I think that's the first point and the effect of that is. Elyas Abaris 35:27 Yes. 35:31 It's it's shutting off. Or constraining the breadth of your learning and knowledge because it doesn't cover the entirety of the curriculum, but instead effectively. It's sort of the tail way. The dog lecture cast determines what you're examined on, so that's. That's the first point. And then the second point. And I just wondered just for my own benefit, the Open book 24 Hour exam format that you mentioned. Elyas Abaris 35:56 Yep. 35:57 Was that it? Was that a? New approach. I mean, how had exams been conducted previously? What? What was it always done that way? But just with the broader curriculum or how did it work in the past? Elyas Abaris 36:08 That was a completely new approach that they'd only told us about, I think less than a month before the exams, so we had no idea what we were preparing for up until that point and it was only done for us that year. I think, yeah. 36:25 I see. And so it's effectively they're saying it. Here's the content. Here's the exam. We're putting it on a plate for you, you know, to sort of make up, if you like, for the fact that you've not had the tuition that you should have had. We've not had the experience is that is that it in a nutshell, is that what was going on in your view? Elyas Abaris 36:44 I mean, yeah, absolutely. It was. I don't think anyone failed that exam. I think it was a free pass in sort of light of the fact that things were so difficult, which, you know at the time when I was in second year was appreciated. But you know, once you move on to sort of 4th year, fifth year, where anything that you've had in first and second year is never revisited and it's sort of the basis for clinical sciences later on you're sort of expected to have that base level knowledge and. You don't and you realise that you've never actually identified what you do and what you don't know. And you sort of realise that you have these gaps and you have to go back and revisit things that is now just assumed knowledge and that you're not really scheduled to have time to do. 37:29 So it's denying you the opportunity to have built that foundation first time around, yeah. Elyas Abaris 37:33 Yeah. 37:36 That's very interesting. I mean this is because, you know, because part of the. Part of the debate or the legal debate here is about. What is it that you contracted for and what should you have had and UC LS? Intention on this",

And it's really interesting to hear you talk about it first hand, how it was this sort of. On a plate exam, I mean it's. It's fascinating. But anyway, just an observation. And I think you mentioned as well, I think you sent an e-mail voicing your concerns about the mode of teaching at the time. And I think well, unless there's other emails. I'm going to bring up e-mail on the screen that you sent in June 2020. Elyas Abaris 38:59 Yes, this is one. 39:01 And this is one of I think he sent a couple a couple at the time. Elyas Abaris 39:05 Yep, and. 39:09 Get to the beginning of the chain. Oh, no, I think, yeah, I think this is one of them. Elyas Abaris 39:15 I mean, yeah. And then even from that point, I was worried specifically about the clinical skills and the ability to work in a lab. 39:24 Yeah, yeah. It's there in black and white, yes. I think you also mentioned that that you and a lot of your friends were like that. There was a group of you and you were sort of in the same position you were all supposed. Was it, was it fair to say that you're sort of anxious about what? What your course might entail? At what precise? How precisely it will be delivered, I don't know. Were there discussions on were these your course friends? Their discussions that you had maybe on WhatsApp or were they friends that you had like, were there a few of you that were voicing these concerns at the time? Elyas Abaris 40:17 I'm scrolling back on WhatsApp as we speak in our group chat to see if I I think off the top of my head. I do remember us talking about them being quite worried about it. I'm just trying to find it now to see if there's anything concrete. Sorry it's taking a while. 40:40 Don't worry if if you want alias we you can. You can maybe revisit that after we don't, we don't need to take your time up now. But if if you find you go back and look at it later there's there's interesting stuff by all means let us know we can we can find a way to to sort of to see that. But I don't want to.

I don't want to hold you up that necessarily now. Elyas Abaris 40:59 Sure. 41:01 And repeat. He touched on it briefly a few moments ago about your optional choices. I'm going to bring it up in an e-mail. And. Date the 17th of August. And you can see what you wrote today. So I don't know if that drugs any memories for you. But you said I'm very sorry to disturb you. A lot of us are worried about the arrangements for next year regarding whether we need to be in London, our optional module selection. When would be we be told? This information. And I suppose generally regarding your optional module choices, do you feel that? They the choices themselves were more limited, both in terms of what UCL actually offered you at the time, so limited by UCL themselves. In light of the restrict COVID restrictions. As well as whether your choice was any way determined or influenced by what might might be the best for you at the time. In light of those restrictions. Elyas Abaris 42:29 So I think my choices for these optional modules. Were, I think, based mostly on the assessment format, so bearing in mind that everything was going to be online and that we were going to have sort of a very restrictive teaching style. So I think I picked things which I. Thought would be. Easier to do with such limited you know teaching. 43:07 Do you know if you still actually restricted any practical modules as options because of COVID? Elyas Abaris 43:16 So I so I wouldn't I I think off the top of my head, I can't remember, but I'm pretty sure some of the ones I picked definitely had a practical element to them. Prior to COVID. I think both of them had some sort of tight lab time involved prior to COVID. And obviously this wasn't the case. 43:44 I see. And you say that your choices were more determined on the format of the assessment might take. Did you feel like it impacted? Your. The the restricted you know the online teaching and the mode of teaching. If it wasn't for the online mode of teaching, do you think that you would have made different choices, different options? Elyas Abaris 44:14 I think absolutely. I think I would have been, you know, more likely to pick something I'm genuinely interested in or something that gave me sort of more interesting, practical opportunities and things like that. But you know, with such restrict with like so many restrictions I just had to think practically. 44:33 So you took a pragmatic approach. Just thought what's the best way to get through this as opposed to, you know, doing what I really want to do and then thriving and enjoying. Elyas Abaris 44:35 Yeah. 44:46 My experience here because because obviously the tissue probably will come up to this, but one of the elements of your claim is it is a is a damages for disappointment elements.

Disruption survey, which is my understanding. It's just it's it's a form. That you can submit to potentially request additional time to complete your project. Elyas Abaris 46:21 Mm hmm. 46:22 And you submitted it. A March 2021, and I think this is going to the the lecturer that you or your supervisor that you identified. If you kick a firm so you say your supervisor was away for a month due to personal reasons. The final idea of what I'd be doing was not decided until he returned, and then you mentioned. That you didn't start anything because you were waiting until they returned and confirmed that you would still be working. On PNP 3 and what your project would actually entail, and he does not want to go. Through the lab. Elyas Abaris 47:12 Yep. 47:13 Was this the particular lecture that you were referring to that was shielded at the time? Elyas Abaris 47:19 Yes, it it, it's. Yeah. This is the same supervisor. 47:25 OK. And and what actually happened after you submitted that did were you able to so you were able to access the lab with the PhD student that they allocated to you for a bit? Elyas Abaris 47:40 So I so I think throughout my The thing is quite difficult because from the beginning the project was supposed to be heavily lab based and sort of everything that we'd prepared for was for it to be lab based. The briefing I'd received was that it was lab based and you know the results I was looking for were things that I'd only be able to get in lab. The my supervisor was able to go in with me. I think a few times like you know. I'd say maximum maximum sort of five times ever. I'd probably less, and I think I'd gone in once with a PhD student. And I was left with, you know, data that didn't fully answer the questions that I had originally set out to answer and that my supervisor had sort of set up for me to answer. And when I was writing my dissertation, I had to sort of completely change the angle. Of my project to fit the very limited lab work I had and sort of pad it with more library based things. Even though that had never sort of been the original aim, and I never received any guidance around that. 49:06 So if if it wasn't for the restrictive the the restrictions on the lab use your dissertation would have been very different.

Elyas Abaris 49:20 It it would have been completely different, yeah. I yeah, 'cause I had to pad so much of my dissertation with library based things. To have anything significant to speak about. 49:35 I see. And just to clarify, the restrictions of the lab work, were they as a result of? Universal COVID restrictions? Or was that just specifically in relation to the issues or or the the lack of supervision from your supervisor at the time because he was shielding was it? Was it a specific problem relating to? To your situation, I suppose. Or was it a wider problem that you were able to access that time? Elyas Abaris 50:06 I I think it's sort of a mixture of both. I think the fact that I mean COVID as a whole meant that the labs had sort of a lower capacity. And there were less people there who would be able to offer guidance, you know, in case my supervisor couldn't make it. But also it was very difficult because my supervisor could hardly ever make it. 50:33 Understood. Thanks. I had a question about learning additional learning support, so it is said I'm going to find it, but it is said in UC LS defence. Elyas Abaris 50:47 Mm hmm. 50:58 Your play. Paragraph 33 that they provided additional learning support and assistance to the claimant during 20/19/20 epidemic year, including on March the 20 March 2020 emailing students extending the date of a drug profile assignment by one week. I mean, this is sort of if these are their plan points, they're they're not particularly impressive, but anyway there it is, doctor Shane Minogue arranging special access to electronic textbooks from 24 April when libraries were closed and the university amending its academic manual to provide the additional support. And widen its degree classification borderlines to the advantage of students just taking those 1 by 1. This emailing of students to extend the date of the drug profile assignment firstly, I mean you may not remember that does that. Does that ring any bells with you this is. May 2020. Elyas Abaris 51:52 I mean, yes, I, I I remember this quite this. I think this was in second year. 51:57 Yeah. Elyas Abaris 51:57 And I I don't think it was ever really a sort of a serious problem or something. I was worried about because it didn't doesn't count to anything. It never counted to anything. You didn't need to do well in it to pass. It was sort of just something formative. 52:12 Yeah. Elyas Abaris 52:13 For you to sort of do your own research on a drug and then they tell you, oh, OK, well, you're not very good at writing drug profiles, you know, do better next time. It never really mattered. It was never something I was worried about. So, you know, it was. Sort of a gesture just. 52:29 A suggestion for. Which we won't afford them too much credit, yeah.

Any any recollection of that or any thoughts, comments on its impact or otherwise? Elyas Abaris 52:47 I mean, again, this was all for second year in which we had completely open book Google of ALL exams. So it didn't really sort of have any impact on how I did in my assessment. And I don't think it makes up for sort of lack of, you know, proper lectures. Because I'm I'm paying to attend lectures and paying to attend lab facilities, I'm not paying to have access to textbooks. 53:17 Yeah, exactly, exactly. Elyas Abaris 53:17 Xbox. Yeah. 53:20 Understood. And then the last one which we. Kind of touched. On indirectly already is the the amendment of the university's academic manual to provide the additional support and widen widening of its degree classification borderlines to the advantage of students. I mean, I think what this means is. You know, I suppose they made it easier if you'd like to get higher grades, but I mean, this goes back to, I think the point you were making before, which is you're not there just to get a piece of paper, you're there to get the university experience that you expected signed up for and have paid for, so. Query how much credit they should be given for doing this. I mean, it seems to me as I say that that seems to me to be what you what your view of this is. Is that fair? Elyas Abaris 54:01 I mean, yeah, absolutely. Because when I'm, you know, working as a doctor and I'm on the wards, I'm not going to be grateful that I got an easy ride. I'm going to be grateful that I have the skills and the knowledge to, you know, save my patients lives. 54:15 Very well. Very well put. Yeah, I think that's that's the response. And then in terms of the library, I mean, I'll go through these for what it's worth. But they they say that their library services put in place a web page which was updated daily with information about online library support, I mean. Return returns of books on loan were extended and fines were waived. Any of this having an impact on you or jogging memories or any thoughts on this? Elyas Abaris 54:43 Not particularly. I'm not a very textbook person. I don't. I don't think I've any point you use textbooks to supplement my knowledge. I. Yeah, that was never my style of studying, and it never really helped me out. 54:59 Understood. But I think it and. Say online skills. Sorry, go ahead. Elyas Abaris 55:04 I think. Sorry, I think just relevant to the bit before about the widening. The thing for the classifications. 55:15 Yeah. Elyas Abaris 55:15 Medicine is an unclassified degree to begin with. So it never really mattered. The only year where it mattered was the 3rd year, which was the year out of medicine. And even then I think I. My grade was high enough that it wouldn't have mattered and that I wasn't impacted by it. 55:38 I see. Elyas Abaris 55:38 But the.",

My grade was high enough that it wouldn't have mattered and that I wasn't impacted by it. 55:38 I see. Elyas Abaris 55:38 But the. The thing is, UCL seems to claim that because I did well in the end because I achieved the first in the end that they did a good job. But the thing like the reason why I got a first is because I had to work that much harder and I succeeded in working that much harder. Not because they lowered the grade boundaries, which I wasn't affected by at all. 56:00 Yes. That's interesting. So just if I can just dig into that a little bit further, is your point that, let's say, I mean I don't know how much they shifted the boundaries by, but I think your point is that your marks were so high that if they shifted them by tempers, I don't know what it was. Then it wouldn't have made any difference to you because you had you've. Got. A high first. So even if they've knocked it down, by how many percent you still would have got. A. First do do you know do you know what the specifics were in terms of battery? You got a sense of that, yes. Elyas Abaris 56:32 I think I think it was no point. I think they had a null .5% leeway. So I think if you'd gotten 69.5% and above, whereas before that would be a second class. They they would bump that up to a first class, so you know, it was a very minimal difference. And since I'd gotten above 70 anyway, it wouldn't have affected me at all. 56:52 Now. Well, that makes. Sense. OK, so that is quite a marginal change. OK. I'm just wondering if I I mean. There's one other point that I'll raise just for completeness, although it seems a bit petty on their part. 1 of the points they make, which is really something for us to address in legal submissions, is that even effectively, even if facilities have been available, you were not ready, willing and able to. The teachers can. Ask you some questions. About residence, but I had a very quick basic question, which is. They say of you that you are not ready, willing and able to attend in person tuition or to physically access relevant facilities. It would not have done so, in particular when you were unavailable because you had to attend an orthodontist appointment. That's right, it's only 3rd of October 2020, which is just really again, these. These are that sort of Plumb points. What did you? I mean, I don't want to say it. Did you have an appointment that day? Is it doesn't seem very material to me say, to argue that you missed one session. If you did. I mean, I don't have to. Say they've obviously found an e-mail in which you say I, yeah. Elyas Abaris 58:00 I mean, I think it, yeah. I mean, yeah, it's it is absolutely ridiculous. 'cause. I attended every other face to face session. I had to leave for I think I one hour early like in a 7 hour day to yeah attend an emergency orthodontist appointment because I think my",

I had to leave for I think I one hour early like in a 7 hour day to yeah attend an emergency orthodontist appointment because I think my gums were bleeding or something. And apparently that meant that I didn't care enough to attend in person teaching. 58:22 Thanks. Right. That's right. Here it is. Paragraph 52.1 going to be the centre point of the case. Elyas Abaris 58:30 Yeah. 58:34 Yes, but OK, I think I think actually make sure that people. I think those attuned to Tisha, that's what I had. Just got a couple of specific points to offer. I didn't. The first one is generally about how often. You were on UC LS website checking for updates like one of the points that they made with is that we publish all the coronavirus FAQs and the latest COVID information on the website for the student. To look at. So it was there and it was there, you know, it was possibility to to, to read about it. Did you regularly check their? Website Or, you know, were they more? Were you relying on more contact from them? Elyas Abaris 59:30 So the The thing is, is the medical school is a completely separate entity to, you know, the rest of the university. Things operate differently in the medical school to the entire rest of the university. So some things that may have been relevant for the rest of the university were not relevant to us. And so we were relying solely on information that we received from the medical school. And so yes, they would upload that to Moodle, but we wouldn't have to check it every day because whenever an update was posted. We'd get it through to our emails anyway, so it's not something that I'd have to regularly do because it would come to my e-mail anyway and I'd only check if I wanted to, you know, cross check a rule or something like that. 1:00:16 Helpful and completely understood. And just another discrete point that UCL make in their defence, which I think is, you know, if if I put myself in your shoes, I think it's ridiculous. But they asked, well, they said at any point you could have stopped or halted your course. You know, if you weren't satisfied with the teaching. Or the mode of teaching or the facilities, etcetera. Did you ever consider? Faulting or stopping your corpse at any point because of, you know, the circumstances that you faced during your course. Elyas Abaris 1:00:59 I mean. Not at all. And for a variety of reasons, I think the main being financial burden, you know, I'd I'd already paid. I'd already signed a contract to live in London for the entire year. My student loan had already gone out for that year. The entire time I was at university, I was working multiple part time jobs to sort of support me through it, and I applied every single year for the UCL bursary. And I think the financial constraints alone made it very difficult and the fact that you know that would be a year of student loan used up that I wouldn't be able to have if I apply to a different university. Just made it ridiculous because I",

And I think the financial constraints alone made it very difficult and the fact that you know that would be a year of student loan used up that I wouldn't be able to have if I apply to a different university. Just made it ridiculous because I think by that point I would have been in 3rd year and that's sort of at least two years gone of my student loan that I'd have to self fund if I went anywhere else, which would have been impossible. And I think other than that, I'd the fact that if I went somewhere else, you can't just transfer degrees. I'd have to start again from the beginning. I'd have to go through the lengthy application process again. I'd have to go through interviews. You know, it's just not. It's completely impractical. And I think it's just not realistic at all. 1:02:15 Yeah, I mean just just for some context, the the reason you see how pushing this point is because of the terms of their contract and what what there is a debate about the extent of your rights as a party contracting with UCL is. The right you have if you are dissatisfied is a right to terminate effectively. And exit the courts. But of course. We will say and then they know full well that somebody in your position as you've just described it, I don't need to repeat it. It is never going to do that and it's not in a position to do that. So it is an unrealistic proposition, but that's that's the background, that's why it's been. That's why it speaks to just. Elyas Abaris 1:02:55 Yeah. 1:03:00 Thank you. And something there, Adam mentioned earlier that we touched on was regarding your claim. In distress and disappointment, and I know. The EU briefly mentioned that in some of the previous in the previous interview, but at a high level, what was particularly what was the most disappointing or distressing elements to the teaching moving online. Elyas Abaris 1:03:34 I think. I mean it differs year by year, but I think. The I think I've already touched upon the fact that in second year the fact that everything moved online, the fact that the assessments were so different, although they didn't have an impact at the time they made my life much harder in fourth year where you know everything is assumed knowledge and. You know, you realise you don't know what you thought you knew and you're having to play catch up and there's already so much to learn of. Just. And to have to go back and learn what you and UCL both assumed you already knew. You know it's it's it's extremely stressful because you barely have been enough time to cover the actual 14 material to begin with. And. 1:04:27 Yeah, that's interesting point. And I imagine that's on top of the sort of contemporaneous distress and disappointment that you're feeling by virtue of the fact that your degree has been turned upside down and you're not getting. What you thought? You were going to get and everything that you'd expected and maybe become used to some extent first. Year or so went out of the window and that I'm assuming you tell me if I'm wrong, that that innovates in, in and of itself gave rise to stress uncertainty at this point. That'd",

Elyas Abaris 1:04:59 Yeah, it's absolutely. I mean, you know, all these decisions I made early on were supposed to set me up for the later years. You know, my choice of clinical sciences, my sort of desire to, you know, practise all these practical skills, which in the end I didn't get the ability to do, which ended up, you know, hurting me in my 4th year exams. And. I mean, yeah. I mean UCL. 1:05:26 Sorry, some of these questions seem obvious, but it's just we just want to cover the ground. Elyas Abaris 1:05:31 And there, that's fine. I mean, UCL claims to that. I've never sort of voiced any concerns or anything like that. But I think in my 4th year exams, I sort of I think even before the 4th year exams, I think part way through my 4th year I'd made it aware to one of my supervisors that I was sort of, you know dealing with a new diagnosis of anxiety. You know, as a result of the situation's going on and she sort of reached out to student support to contact me about it. And in the end, when I did end up having to retake my exams, I reached out to student support again about sort of getting extra measures in place that, you know, support with that which in the end I think equated to asking examiners in practical exams just to be nicer. Was, I think what I got from that, I think. But you know, I did make it clear to UCL that, you know. That things weren't OK, and so, you know, their claim that I'd never sort of voiced anything, just not correct. 1:06:41 Yeah, understood. And it's it's a, it's a brief point, but. UCL. They have taken a point. Against all most, if not all, of the tests claim it's in relation to their residency. Elyas Abaris 1:07:06 Mm hmm. 1:07:08 And I know that you have very kindly you sent over your tenancy agreements, I believe, but were there, were there any periods generally when? Elyas Abaris 1:07:13 Yep. 1:07:19 You weren't in London or you were sort of away from an extended period, and I'm thinking maybe. After 2000, between 2019 two 1020. To 22, can you think of a recall? Any large gaps at all where you may not have been in? Elyas Abaris 1:07:40 I mean, no, my family live in London. I sort of had no realistic reason to leave. You know, I I had my accommodation paid for, you know, it's it's the school year. We're not going anywhere because of COVID. Anyway, there's nowhere to go on holiday to. I was obviously going to stay in the fact that I was paying a lot of money for. You know to be ready and willing to attend face to face teaching. 1:08:09 Yeah, absolutely. So, so, so your family home was in, in, in London and but you were renting a flat. Elyas Abaris 1:08:13 Yep. 1:08:17 While you were staying, I mean, were they close to each other",

So all the of the flats that I rented were sort of in the region surrounding UCL within, I'd say a 20 minute walk. Whereas if I was staying with my family, it'd be sort of it'd take me over an maybe an hour to get in. 1:08:36 OK. Elyas Abaris 1:08:37 And I mean other than that, it'd be the fact that sort of I had younger siblings at home and it wouldn't be conducive to sort of any sort of studying. 1:08:44 I understood so. So so your property, the property that you're renting with central London and your family home was sort of more further out zone fours and something like that. Or was it? Yeah, got it. Elyas Abaris 1:08:55 Yep. 1:09:02 Perfect. Just. Finally, you're ground up. I don't know whether you can something that we what we had in mind if there was somebody appropriate. Was. If you knew of anybody who you voiced it this your experiences to at the time, or somebody who might want to potentially come and essentially. Confirm your experiences and. A test to essentially your story. I don't know if you can think of anybody in mind that you've sort of had close contact with. That you shared your experiences with that might be beneficial to bringing in as a witness. Elyas Abaris 1:09:54 It's it's quite difficult because we've all sort of gone separate ways after graduation and I can't think of anyone off the top of my head that I'm still in contact with who, who would be able to do that. I mean, obviously, I've voiced my sort of concerns to my parents, but. You know I'm. I'm. 1:10:13 You know it's it's. Yeah, I understand. It's not. This isn't this isn't essential. It's really, you know, in some cases we might have run a situation to where somebody has a roommate, that they're with the whole time or a fellow student or whoever it may be who has sort of shared experiences. But. But, you know, if. Something subsequently occurs to you, then let us know, but it's not. It's not an essential requirement. Don't worry. OK. Anything else? I think we covered. OK. Well, Alice, thank thank you very much for giving us that time, I think. What we will do now?

Introduction 1 I am a partner in the firm of Harcus Parker Limited, which has conduct of this matter on behalf of Harbour Fund II , L.P. (\u201cHarbour \u201d). This is my 20thth witness statement in this action (the \u201c Proceedings \u201d) and is made following the conclusion of the trial pursuant to which Mr Justice Foxton rendered his judgment on 18 May 2021 (the \u201c Directed Trial Judgment \u201d)1 and subsequent Consequentials Order dated 11 June 2021 (the \u201cConsequentials Order \u201d) (pages 1-20). 1 The Serious Fraud Office & Anor v Litigation Capital Ltd & Ors [2021] EWHC 1272 (Comm) (18 May 2021) (bailii.org) 2 2 Insofar as the contents of this witness statement are within my own knowledge they are true and , insofar as they are based on things I have read or which have been told to me by others, they are true to the best of my information and belief (the source of such information and belief being identified below). 3 Nothing I say in this witness statement constitutes, or is intended to constitute, a waiver of Harbour\u2019s legal professional privilege or that of the Settlement Parties (as hereinafter defined) . 4 There is now shown to me a bundle of paginated documents marked AKZ -20 containing true cop ies of the documents to which I refer herein. 5 I make this statement in support of Harbour\u2019s application for various relief as set out in draft order provided with the application. In summary, Harbour seeks : 5.1 An order or declaration to the effect that Dr Cochrane is not permitted to seek to challenge the outcome of the Directed Trial (to include the Court\u2019s findings in relation to the ownership of Orb, and its conclusions concerning Harbour\u2019s entitlements based on its Investment Agreement), by reason of her signing the LCL Settlement Agreement as well as a deed dated 23 October 20142 (the \u201c 2014 Harbour Deed \u201d) (pages 21 \u2013 31) (addressed further below); 5.2 An order or declaration to the effect that any attempt now made (whether by Dr Cochrane, Mr Thomas or anyone else) to raise arguments challenging Harbour\u2019s entitlements as found in the Directed Trial, or otherwise seeking to disturb the outcome of the Directed Trial, is an abuse of process or otherwise barred by doctrines of estoppel or similar principles , or is time barred , including (in the case of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas ) estoppe l by the terms of the Harbour Deed ); 5.3 An order or declaration rejecting any argument to the effect that the Harbour IA is unenforceable by reason of the decision of the Supreme Court in R (on the application of PACCAR Inc and others (Appellants) v Competition Appeal Tribunal and others (Respondents) [2023] UKSC 28 (the",

While Mr Thomas has often corresponded with Harbour and the other Settlement Parties on behalf of himself and Mr Taylor , I understand that Mr Taylor may no longer be involved in this matter on a day to day basis. Notably, as I explain further below, Mr Thomas has recently caused a letter before action to be sent to Harbour and has instructed solicitors in his sole name. 4 Damages Based Agreements Regulation (SI 2013/609), the Harbour IA was at all material times and is unenforceable .\u201d4 11 By the Jersey Recall Application s, Dr Cochrane effectively seeks to cancel or unwind her bankruptcy",

As such, Harbour has sought a stay of the Jersey Recall Application s pending the determination of this Application5. 13 In response to its stay application , pursuant to a hearing on 25 June 2024 the Royal Court of Jersey directed Harbour to inter alia produce to it a draft of th is Application by 2 August 2024, which it did. A hearing is listed on 12 November 2024 before the Jersey Court to determine Harbour\u2019s stay application , but in the meantime Harbour considers it appropriate to proceed as intended, now that its interactions with Mr Thomas (set out below) appear to have reached their natural conclusion in terms of their usefulness . 14 In addition to (and I believe in connection with) the Jersey Recall Applications, on 11 July 2024 Harbour received a letter before action from Marriot Harrison LLP, instructed by Mr Thomas (the \u201c Thomas Letter Before Action \u201d) (pages 87-106). According to the Thomas Letter Before Action , Mr Thomas now intends to challenge the validity of the Harbour IA in the English Courts, on the basis of the PACCAR Decision. 15 Correspondence has passed between Marriott Harrison and my firm since my firm\u2019s receipt of the Thomas Letter Before Action (pages 107-145), regarding appropriate pre - action steps and the applicability of the 31 March 2023 Order of Foxton J , which required Messrs Thomas and Taylor to provide evidence regarding their source of funding for any 4 Paragraph 7 of Dr Cochrane\u2019s A mended Representation (page 978) 5 Harbour had originally intended to seek a stay in reliance upon the passage through Parliament of the Litigation Funding (Enforceability) Bill, which had been expected to pass into law this year and cure with retrospective effect any PACCAR issues, but did not as a result of the calling of the election on 4 July 2024. 5 further application of claim against the Settlement Parties, along with disclosing any involvement of Dr Smith or related parties as well as satisfying their considerable outstanding costs orders in favour of the Settlement Parties, before any such applica tion or claim would be allowed to proceed (the \" Debarring/Stay Directions \"). 16 For context, I note that Mr Thomas\u2019 potential action has been threatened obliquely for many months and was referred to by counsel for Dr Cochrane at the Convening Hearing that took place on 6 February 2024 in respect of the Jersey Recall Applications (a note of the hearing , prepared by Harbour\u2019s Jersey",

The cooperation between M r Thomas and Dr Cochrane (doubtless both under the direction of and in conjunction with Dr Smith) is apparent both from this reference and the Thomas Letter Before Action , which expressly refers to the Jersey Recall Applications , notwithstanding the fact that he is not ostensibly involved in th e Jersey proceedings .6 17 As indicated above, m y firm has exchanged correspond ence with Marriott Harrison with a view to narrowing the issues between our respective clients . This has included our provi sion to them of a draft of this application as filed with the Jersey Court on 2 August 2024 (including a draft of this witness statement, albeit that it has since been further developed in some respects ). Despite this, it has unfortunately not been possible for the parties to narrow their differences , with the parties\u2019 positions being diametrically opposed . As part of this correspondence , we have repeatedly invited Mr Thomas to set out in detail the consequences of the relief he intends to seek \u2013 in other words \u2013 what the effect would be on the findings made in the Directed Trial Judgment as reflected in the Consequentials Order of an order declaring the Harbour IA to be unenforceable . This is an important point in circumstances where Mr Thomas\u2019 own case at the Directed Trial was advanced on the basis of proprietary rights he asserted as having arise n under the Harbour Trust , and he advanced no alternative proprietary claim. In their letter dated 25 September 2024, Marriott Harrison have said that the effect of their client\u2019s application succeeding would be that Harbour would not be entitled to any part of the assets listed in paragraph 4 of the Consequential s Order and their beneficial owners would be the Orb Claimants. No 6 I note that in an affidavit served by Dr Cochrane on 24 September 2024 in support of the Jersey Recall Applications, Dr Cochrane stated \u201cwhile I am aware of other proceedings being taken in respect of the illegality issue and other matters, I am not acting in concert with any others \u201d. Unfortunately, given my and my client\u2019s extensive experience in these proceedings, I do not accept that either this Court or the Jersey Court can take this suggestion at face value . 6 detailed analysis has been provi ded of how this alleged beneficial interest arises or its interaction with third party proprietary claims advanced at the Directed Trial . 18 Mr Thomas has also sought to argue that the terms of the Debarring /Stay Directions did not reflect the Court\u2019s ruling of 31 March 2023 and has sought to question the way in which the draft order was finalised, despite having been copied on all relevant correspondence with the Court regarding the same , and his comments on the draft having been provided to the Court .

In particular, he suggests via Marriott Harrison that the Court\u2019s only intenti on was that he should be required to pay outstanding costs orders in order to pursue any claim or application against the Settlement Parties. 19 In terms of the position in relation to the outstanding costs orders, Mr Thomas has settled the outstanding costs payments to Harbour due under paragraph 25 of the costs Order of 21 October 2021 , paragraph 3 of the costs order of 8 July 20227and paragraph 8 of the costs order of 24 March 2023. The final costs order was settled by Mr Thomas on 22 October 2024. 20 However, Harbour considers it to be clear that , given the content of Harbour\u2019s application for a debarring order and the Court\u2019s previous experience of Mr Thomas\u2019 conduct in the Part 8 Proceedings and the revelations as to the funding of that matter , the Court i ntended what its order requires, i.e. that Mr Thomas should also provide evidence of both (a) the source of funding for any further claim or application and (b) the involvement of Dr Smith and Mr McNally , or any persons Mr Thomas knows the be associated with them . The Debarring/Stay Directions accordingly accurately reflect the Court\u2019s intention . Harbour\u2019s position, which m y firm has conveyed to Mr Thomas \u2019s solicitors is that the terms of the Debarring/Stay Directions will apply in the event that Mr Thomas files his threatened 7 My understanding, derived from discussions with Stewarts (privilege in relation to which is not waived) is that Messrs Thomas and Taylor were able to make this payment pursuant to a settlement reached with St Paul \u2019s Solicitors (in liquidation) (\u201cSt Paul \u2019s\u201d), a firm instructed by them on various occasions in these proceedings , and previous ly run by Mr Andrew Crossley . My understanding is that on 16 May 2023, Messrs Thomas and Taylor filed a professional negligence claim against St Pauls (the \u201c St Paul\u2019s Claim \u201d), due to the failure by St Paul \u2019s to serve the particulars of claim in separate proceedings against Stewarts which were consequently dismissed by the court . Ultimately, St Paul \u2019s insurer settled the claim . In the interim, as the Court is aware, Stewarts Law filed a third party debt order application (\u201cTPDO Application \u201d) in respect of the settlement monies . On 9 July 2024 , the TPDO Application was dismissed by consent , on terms that provided for (inter alia) significant payments to the funder and ATE providers in respect of Messrs Thomas and Taylor \u2019s negligence claim, a firm of solicitors, as well as payments in respect of Messrs Thomas and Taylor\u2019s outstanding costs obligations. The relevant consent order (\u201c TPDO Consent Order \u201d) is at pages 157 - 159. While I am not aware of the full background to the St Paul \u2019s Claim, I note that St Paul\u2019s appear s to have accepted that it breached the duties it owed to Messrs Thomas and Taylor relatively soon after the negligence action was commenced . Mr Crossley is currently a consultant at another firm, Taylor Rose .

The Debarring/Stay Directions were made in light of Mr Thomas\u2019s repeated efforts to obstruct the Settlement Parties \u2019 efforts to enforce their rights pursuant to the Directed Trial, with support and funding provided by Dr Smith and his associates , and ul timately in those parties\u2019 interests . 22 In light of all of the above , Harbour seeks, by this Application, to achieve a (further) confirmation of finality in terms of the status of the Directed Trial Judgment and related orders and the Harbour IA , such that the Smith Parties are precluded , to the greatest extent possible, from continuing to interfere with the judicial findings of this Court with the result that the realisation process can continue unimpeded . Harbour is aware that to the extent that it is required to go beyond questions of whether Mr Thomas or Dr Cochrane are shut out from re -opening argument, this Application may engage the interests of other parties to the se proceedings . Given the lack of clarity provided by Mar riott Harrison in respect of Mr Thomas\u2019s intended course of action, other parties may argue that, should Mr Thomas succeed, this could potentially re -engage those other parties\u2019 interests in the assets which were the subject of the Directed Trial. 23 As such, if Mr Thomas complies with all the provisions of the Debarring/Stay Directions and this Application is subsequently opposed by Mr Thomas, these type of extremely complex follow -on issues (as well as alternative arguments potentially available to Harbour to sustain its rights) mean that the overriding objective is likely to be best served by case managing issues of principle to be resolved at a first stage, and only if: (a) arguments based on the PACCAR Decision are open to Mr Thomas (and Dr Cochran e); and (b) are successful, to then convene a second stage which can take account of these broader questions . Harbour intends to make more detailed case management proposals in this regard once the initial round of evidence has been exchanged in response to this Application. 24 I should note that Harbour presents this application to this Court, because this Court has substantial familiarity with the underlying history and plainly has an interest in seeing its 8 existing findings and conclusions respected. In addition, the agreements that are the subject of the relevant disputes are governed by English law and contain jurisdiction clauses in favour of the English Courts. It appears, from the Thomas Letter Before Action , that Mr Thomas also envisages bringing his challenge before this Court. However , I note for completeness that the Court\u2019s view may be that although the English Courts are competent and best placed to hear these issues, some of the arguments being co ntemplated by Mr Thomas can only be (or",

However , I note for completeness that the Court\u2019s view may be that although the English Courts are competent and best placed to hear these issues, some of the arguments being co ntemplated by Mr Thomas can only be (or are most appropriately) pursued by way of application for permission to appeal the outcome of the Directed Trial to the Court of Appeal , albeit long out of time , rather than to the first instance Court . 25 Indeed, I note in this regard that on 28 September 2023, Mr Thomas wrote to Harbour (on an open basis) enclosing a draft appellant\u2019s notice . Mr Thomas stated in the accompanying letter (marked \u201cUrgent and Immediate \u201d) that his intention was to \u201cappeal against the Directed Trial Judgement of Foxton J. (in particular various terms of the 11 June Consequentials Order, the 14 December 2022 Tru st and Receivership Orders, and the 31 March 2023 Directions (Debarring/Stay application order) \u201d (pages 160-172). Mr Thom as acknowledged that the proposed appeal was out of time, and sought Harbour\u2019s consent to its terms . 26 My firm responded on 29 September 2023 , noting that Mr Thomas\u2019s letter was not accompan ied by grounds of appeal , skeleton argument, any evidence in support o r draft orders (pages 173-174). In fact , it set out no grounds at all for the proposed appeal. Our email stated that we would consider the substance of the application when such materials were provided. Mr Thomas provided no such further materials . 27 I note that Mr Thomas , nine months after his intimated appeal to the Court of Appeal , appears to have decided to take a different approach , instead propos ing to ap ply to th is Court . 28 At this point, as noted above, the precise form of relief sought by Mr Thomas is not entirely clear. The Thomas Letter Before Action concludes that Harbour is \u201c not entitled to any sums from the Proceeds pursuant to the Harbour IA and all of the assets held pursuant to the Harbour Trust are to be released to the funded parties in their appropriate proportions .\u201d and that \u201cAppropriate consequential steps will follow in respect of the assets currently held pursuant to the Harbour Trust, which we would also seek to agree with you without the need for litigation .\u201d. When my firm p ressed for further details of Mr Thomas\u2019s intended relief, Marriott Harrison responded that : 9 \u201c1. It is perfectly clear that if our client succeeds in demonstrating that the Harbour IA (or any specific DBA part of it) is unenforceable: (i) Harbour will not be entitled to any part of the assets listed in paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order (and we note that you do not argue to the contrary); and (ii) their beneficial owners would be the Orb Claimants (in their appropriate proportions) as the claimants in the claim of which these assets are the proceeds. \u201d 29 It is therefore not entirely clear what the appropriate procedural route for such relief sought by Mr Thomas might be , and it is obviously an incomplete analysis, because if Mr Thomas\u2019 rights under the Harbour IA (which were themselves established at the Directed Trial) fall away, he does not articulate how he would nevertheless establish his entitlement to any relevant a ssets.

Despite this, and w hilst it will be a matter primarily for submissions , I would respectfully suggest that at least some of the reli ef sought by way of this Application can properly be sought from the first instance Court \u2013 by way of example, this Court can rule on the request for relief concerning Dr Cochrane and the LCL Settlement Agreement (which we expand upon at paragraph 84-97 below) , and this Court can also, for example, confirm the present validity of its existing findings so far as it is concerned \u2013 without trespassing on any matters which might fall within the appellate jurisdiction. Further, the time for pursuing any appeal o f the Directed Trial outcome has long since passed, and indeed the PACCAR Decision is no longer recent (having been handed down over a year ago) , such that it is very difficult to see on what basis any prospective appellant could seek permission to appeal out of time from the Court of Appeal in any event . 30 It is also not clear what Mr Taylor\u2019s position is on Mr Thomas\u2019s intended relief, or whether he is even aware of this matter. Harbour will serve a copy of this Application on Mr Taylor and invite him to confirm his position in advance of any hearing. 31 Harbour\u2019s position in respect of the relief sought by Mr Thomas is necessarily reserved, pending compliance with the Debarring/ Stay Directions and clarification of the precise approach taken by him in this litigation, and the basis for that approach. However, Harbour does invite this Court to make such orders as are within its jurisdiction to confirm the final nature of the findings and orders it has made, so as to deal as fully as possible with the recent challenges which have been intimated. B. Executive Summary of the basis of the relief sought by Harbour 10 32 In accordance with its obligations under the Harbour IA, Harbour provided nearly \u00a35.2 million of funding to the Orb Claimants, in order for them to pursue claims against Mr Andrew Ruhan and others in proceedings numbered CL-2012 -000625 (the \u201c Orb Litigation \u201d). I will address further below the mechanism by which Harbour\u2019s entitlement to a return on its investment is calculated . However , it is also relevant to note here that Harbour\u2019s entitlements were secured by: 32.1 a debenture giving Harbour fixed and floating charges over the whole, or substantially the whole, of Orb\u2019s property; and 32.2 a guarantee from Dr Cochrane which was in turn secured by a security interest agreement over the shares in Orb. 33 As this Court knows , the Harbour IA is governed by the law of England and Wales (as are the other transaction documents) . 34 Harbour\u2019s position, in summary, is that there is no basis for disturbing the outcome of t he Directed Trial , to include the Consequentials Order . It is too late for any such attempt to be made now to this Court, and i t would be an abuse of process for the Dr Cochrane, or Messrs Thomas and Taylor (or any other party)",

It is too late for any such attempt to be made now to this Court, and i t would be an abuse of process for the Dr Cochrane, or Messrs Thomas and Taylor (or any other party) to argue otherwise. Moreover, (a) so far as Dr Cochrane is concerned, she has signed a Deed by which she has expressly agreed not to pursue such points ; and (b) so far as both Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas are concerned, they signed the 2014 Harbour Deed by which they agreed that the recoveries under the IOM Settlement were to be treated as \u201cProceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings\u201d for the purposes of Cl 9.1 of the Harbour IA an d were to be applied in accordance with the terms of that clause . 35 Further, to the extent that Mr Thomas or others seek to rely on the PACCAR Decisio n, and to the extent this Court is prepared to entertain such arguments at all, its effect was not to make new law regarding whether or not litigation funding agreements , such as the Harbour IA , were Damages Based Agreements (a \u201cDBA \u201d or collectively \u201c DBAs \u201d), subject to the terms of the DBA Regulations 2013 (\u201cthe DBA Regulations \u201d). The argument that the Harbour IA is a DBA has been available to the Orb Claimants since the agree ment was first entered into and the possibility that the funding arrangements such as the Harbour IA were in fact subject to the DBA Regulations ha s been publicly debated in legal, academic and political circles since at least 201 4. 11 36 I will set out further below the extensive opportunities that the Orb Claimants have had prior to and during the Directed Trial to seek to run the arguments that Dr Cochrane now advances in the Jersey Recall Application s, and that Mr Thomas has threatened in the Thomas Letter Before Action . Harbour\u2019s position is that the arguments advanced by both Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas (as well as any argument that she or others may advance in opposition to Harbour\u2019s present application), constitute an abuse of process. In the alternative, if that is not the case, they are time barred. 37 Further , and to the extent necessary , Harbour also contends that in any event, the PACCAR Decision, even on its merits, does not render the Harbour IA unenforceable, or that if it does so to some extent, that it is only unenforceable in part . Again, Harbour\u2019s arguments will be further developed in its submissions, but a summary of the key points advanced, and the evidence upon which they are based, is set out below . 38 The remainder of this witness statement is accordingly divided into the following sections : 38.1 The outcome of the Directed Trial as regards Harbour and the Orb Claimants (Section C) ; 38.2 The Smith Parties\u2019 actions since the Directed Trial (Section D) ; 38.3 The Actions of Dr Cochrane specifically (Section E) ; 38.4 The PACCAR decision and its relevance to the Harbour IA (Section F) ; 38.5 The LCL Settlement Agreement and the 2014 Harbour Deed (Section G) ; 38.6 The abusive nature of the Smith Parties\u2019 attempt to seek to invalidate the Harbour IA (Section H) ; 38.7 Severability of the Harbour IA",

The outcome of the Directed Trial as regards Harbour and the Orb Claimants 39 Given the Court\u2019s familiarity with the Directed Trial, I will not rehearse the extensive background here. By way of summary only, I set out below the salient facts insofar as this Application is concerned. 40 The Directed Trial in these proceedings commenced on 19 January 2021. Shortly thereafter and just before Dr Smith was due to give evidence , on 27 January 2021, the Smith Parties (including Dr Smith and Dr Cochrane, but not including Messrs Thomas and Taylor) entered into a settlement agreement (the \u201c LCL Settlement Agreement \u201d) (pages 175- 337) with Harbour, the Serious Fraud Office (\u201c SFO \u201d), Stewarts Law LLP (\u201c Stewarts \u201d), the liquidators of a group of BVI companies (the \u201c Joint Liquidators \u201d), the Viscount of the Royal Court of Jersey in her capacity as the administrator of the en d\u00e9sastres of Dr Cochrane and Orb (the \u201c Viscount \u201d), and the Receivers of the realisable property of Dr Smith (the \u201c Enforcement Receivers \u201d, together the \u201c Settlement Parties \u201d). The Smith Parties (known in the LCL Settlement Agreement as the LCL Parties) provided undertakings to the Court to assist the Settlement Parties (recorded in an order made on 4 February 2021 (the \u201c LCL Discontinuance Order \u201d)) (pages 338-348) and discontinued their claims , taking no further part in the Directed Trial. 41 On 16 May 2021, the Directed Trial Judgment was handed down. All of the claims advanced by Harbour and the other Settlement Parties succeeded in all material respects. 42 In respect of Orb and Dr Cochrane, the Judge made the following findings: 42.1 The shares of Orb were found to be the realisable property of Dr Smith, further to a Confiscation Order obtained by the SFO on 13 November 2007 in the sum of \u00a340,856,9118 (the \u201c Confiscation Order \u201d). 42.2 More generally, the judge found that Dr Cochrane held the shares in the Non - Arena Companies (including Orb), for Dr Smith, as his nominee. 42.3 Separately, the Judge found that 50% of Bodega (the company which owns Steephill, the property in Jersey in which Dr Cochrane resides) was held by its legal owner (Dr Cochrane) on the terms of the Harbour Trust in respect of which the Judge subsequently, on 14 December 2022, appointed receivers on the application 8 I understand that the current balance of the Confiscation Order, including interest, is around \u00a382 million. 13 of Harbour and others and removed the Orb Claimants as trustees (in a further significant judgment in relation to this matter handed down on 30 November 2022). The remaining 50% is vested in the Viscount as administrator of Dr Cochrane\u2019s d\u00e9sastre . 43 The practical outcome of the Directed Trial was reflected in the Consequentials Order. The Judge ordered the following in respect of Harbour\u2019s and the Orb Claimants\u2019 entitlement: \u201c4. The interests in the following",

The remaining 50% is vested in the Viscount as administrator of Dr Cochrane\u2019s d\u00e9sastre . 43 The practical outcome of the Directed Trial was reflected in the Consequentials Order. The Judge ordered the following in respect of Harbour\u2019s and the Orb Claimants\u2019 entitlement: \u201c4. The interests in the following assets are held by their legal owners on the terms of the Harbour Trust and are to be applied and apportioned between the beneficiaries, namely Harbour, Orb arl, and Messrs Thomas and Taylor, in accordance with those term s (save as set out below): a. The shares in the Arena Companies (as set out in Schedule 2 to this order); b. Such future distributions as may be paid or payable to the shareholders of the Arena Companies; c. The traceable proceeds of the IOM Settlement Cash, but in particular: i. An equitable interest of 100% in Flat 24 Hamilton House; ii. An equitable interest in 50% of the shares in Bodega; iii.

The traceable proceeds of the \u00a323,921,641.59 paid to Candey LLP which derived from the $43.5m Qatar Settlement Payment, but in particular: 14 i. An equitable interest of 90% in Flat 12 Hamilton House (reflecting the balance of the purchase price); ii. An equitable interest of 88.05% in Montagu Square (reflecting the balance of the purchase price); subject to such claims as remain available to Mr Pelz following the findings in the Trial Judgment as set out below at paragraph [23] (for the avoidance of doubt, this qualification applies only to the assets listed at items 2.d.i and ii above). 5. Any share of the proceeds under the Harbour Trust which is attributable to Orb and Messrs Thomas and Taylor shall be adjusted as follows: a. The entitlement of Orb and Messrs Thomas and Taylor (after payment out of the prior items in the waterfall under the Harbour Trust) shall first be determined without any adjustments, based on the following percentages: 62.5% to Orb, 18.75% to Mr Thomas and 18.75% to Mr Taylor; b. Thereafter: i. Mr Thomas is required to give credit in the sum of \u00a31,010,097.75 and his entitlement shall be reduced accordingly; ii.

The equitable interest in the 50% of the shares in Bodega vest in the Viscount of the Royal Court of Jersey in her capacity as administrator of the en d\u00e9sastre of Dr Cochrane, free from adverse proprietary rights.\u201d 45 As to the SFO\u2019s position, the Consequentials Order provided for the following regarding assets that were the realisable property of Dr Smith and therefore subject to the Confiscation Order: \u201c16. With the exception of the shares in Bodega, Dr Gerald Martin Smith holds 100% of the equitable interest in the shares of each of the Non Arena Companies (as set out in Schedule 2 to this order). 17. To the extent that the whole equitable interest in Flat 1 Hamilton House is not exhausted by the equitable interests of the beneficiaries under the Harbour Trust and the companies under the Joint Liquidators\u2019 control respectively, the balance of the eq uitable interest is attributable to Dr Gerald Martin Smith. 18. All of the shares in Litigation Capital Limited are held in the name of Conduit Asset Management Limited for Anthony Smith, who in turn holds them as a nominee for Dr Gerald Martin Smith, who thereby holds a 100% equitable interest in the said shares. 19. Save as otherwise provided for by the declarations in this order any and all residuary equitable interests in the Relevant Property and IUAs are held either by the Viscount of the Royal Court of Jersey, in her capacity as the administrator of the en d\u00e9 sastre (bankruptcy) proceedings of Dr Cochrane, or by Dr Gerald Martin Smith.\u201d 46 The most immediately relevant aspect of the Directed Trial findings in respect of the SFO is that Orb (a Non -Arena Company) is the realisable property of Dr Smith and therefore subject to the SFO\u2019s Confiscation Order , per paragraph 16 of the Consequentials Order. While I understand that Dr Cochrane remains the nominal legal shareholder of Orb, the Consequentials Order is unequivocal : she has no right to Orb or its assets. 16 47 Dr Cochrane sought, by an application of 10 January 2024 of which I provide further details below, to remove Orb from the list of Non -Arena companies in the Consequentials Order, and her application was dismissed and certified as being \u201c totally without merit \u201d. As such, Dr Cochrane has identified no basis for disturbing paragraph 16 of the Consequentials Order. 48 It is particularly notable that Dr Cochrane\u2019s Jersey Recall Applications , and in particular the exercise she proposes in order to assess her personal financial position are premised in large part on an account of Orb\u2019s assets , which she assert ed (wrongly) were to be treated as her own . In her third affidavit of 11 March 2024 , Dr Cochrane also initially claimed to \u201cown 100% of the shares of Orb\u201d (pages 349",

In her third affidavit of 11 March 2024 , Dr Cochrane also initially claimed to \u201cown 100% of the shares of Orb\u201d (pages 349 \u2013 365), and omitted to inform the Jersey Court of the full effect of the Directed Trial\u2019s finding that Orb\u2019s shares constituted the realisable property of Dr Smith. At the hearing of 26 June 2024 , the Jersey Court indicated its disapproval of Dr Cochrane\u2019s failure to e xplain the findings as to Orb in the Directed Trial Judgment given that she was subject t o a duty of full and frank disclosure when seeking permission to serve the Recall Application out of the jurisdiction , and required Dr Cochrane to explain her omission . As I note further below, Dr Cochrane has since amended her position in relation to the shares of Orb. D. The Smith Parties\u2019 actions since the Directed Trial 49 As indicated above, the Smith Parties have by various means sought to frustrate the outcome of the Directed Trial Judgment and related orders. Given the many separate instances, these , with the exception of Dr Cochrane\u2019s activities in Jersey given the recen t nature of the Jersey Recall Applications, are only summarised in this witness statement. Appendix 1 to this statement contains a more detailed record of the activities in question9. 50 The disruptive actions , unlawful conduct and court proceedings issued or necessitated include: 50.1 Resistance on the part of Dr Cochrane of the steps taken by the Enforcement Receivers regarding the control of Casa Coloniches (a Non -Arena Company) ; 9 Appendix 1 cross -refers to official reports provided by the Enforcement Receivers , in accordance with the terms of the Variation Order dated 7 December 2017 (which I refer to by the prefix \u201cMR \u201d) and the Receivership Order date d 14 De cember 2022 . They are restricted to a circulation list which includes Harbour, the Viscount and Mr Thomas, but are otherwise confidential. The Enforcement Receivers have confirmed that these documents may , in redacted form, be referred to for the purp oses of this application. Redactions have been applied in respect of commercially sensitive information. 17 50.2 Failure by Dr Smith and o thers to provide vacant possession of Flats 11, 12, 19, 20 and 21 Hamilton House , in contravention of their court -ordered obligations ; 50.3 The failed Part 8 Claim commenced by Messrs Thomas and Taylor by which , among other things, they sought to appoint Mr Ticehurst as a trustee for an improper purpose , resulting in their being removed as trustees ; 50.4 The commencement and/or defence of five sets of interlinked proceedings in the Republic of the Marshall Islands by associates of Dr Smith including Mr Thomas, which include opposing the recognition of the Enforcement Receivers' appointment over shares of t he Non -Arena Companies; 50.5 Conduct of Mr Thomas in relation to the purported transfer by LCL of it s shares in SMA and GACH which led to the Enforcement Receivers commencing contempt proceedings against him ; 50.6 The actions of Dr Smith which led to his being convicted of contempt of court in July 2022; 50.7 Mr Thomas\u2019 application for permission to appea l the receivership order made by Foxton J on 14 December 2022 and seeking",

This led to the Debarring/Stay Directions (pages 382-384); 50.10 Proceedings involving Mr Sodzawiczny before the Isle of Man courts, which culminated in Mr Thomas and a Mr Miah (who had been involved in the activities referred to at paragraph 50.8 above ) being found to be in contempt of court as a result of their failure to remove a company director whose actions were in breach of an injunction protecting Mr Sodzawiczny\u2019s interests in property in Spain ; 18 50.11 Prolonged o bstruction of the Enforcement Receivers by Dr Cochrane and other Dr Smith associates10 in respect of C\u2019an Agata and Son Montserrat (the \u201cSpanish Properties \u201d); 50.12 Dr Smith and Dr Cochrane purporting to commence an LCIA Arbitration resulting in Mr Sodzawiczny needing to seek and obtaining an anti -arbitration injunction; 50.13 The Slip Rule Application; 50.14 Mr Thomas\u2019s threatened claim against Harbour in respect of his purported rights under the Harbour IA to require H arbour to indemn ify him for his own outstanding costs obligations (pages 3 88 \u2013 389)11; 50.15 Dr Smith being convicted of fraud on 29 July 2024 in relation to fraudulently obtaining COVID -19 Bounce Back Loans , and subsequently on 20 September 2024 sentenced to 18 months imprisonment12.

This matter culminated in a ruling from Foxton J on 18 April 2024 that it had not, which I describe in further detail below ; 10 Mr Thomas wrote to Harbour and the E nforcement Receiver s and well as the Viscount and others on 28 September 2023, claiming that the ERs needed the Orb Claimants\u2019 consent to sell Son Monser rat, and that its proposed sale would be unlawful (pages 385-387). Mr Thomas\u2019s position was entirely incorrect, as confirmed by Foxton J\u2019s 18 April 2024 ruling which I refer to below. 11 On 31 May 2024, we replied to Mr Thomas to indicate that Harbour did not accept the liability alleged in his letter (page 389A ). 12 https://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/news/city -of-london/news/2024/september/man -jailed -for-fraudulently - receiving -a-50000 -covid",

I would respectfully suggest that t he challenges which they have mounted in re liance upon the PACCAR Decision should be considered in that context ; namely, that arguments over enforceability of the Harbour IA are merely the latest means by which these parties seek to undermine decisions of this court with which Dr Smith and others do not agree. E. The actions of Dr Cochrane specifically 53 This section of my witness statement describes certain relevant actions of Dr Cochrane in this jurisdiction and elsewhere both before and after the Directed Trial Judgment . Conduct of Dr Cochrane not covered below is either addresse d in Appendix 1 or has been deemed unnecessary to include at this stage . Correspondence between Dr Cochrane and Harbour since April 2023 14 I note that by his covering letter of the same date , Dr Smith stated that \u201c As this matter will impact the Orb Claimants, Dr Cochrane, the Attorney General of Jersey and Harbour it has been copied to them \u201d. 20 54 In a letter dated 11 April 2023 (pages 439-448) Dr Cochrane alleged breaches by Harbour of the Harbour IA, a conspiracy against the Orb Claimants by Harbour and the Settlement Parties, and that (directly contrary to the findings of the Directed Tr ial) she was personal ly entitle d to the assets of Orb. Specifically, her letter stated : \u201cby failing to honour [Harbour\u2019s] agreements terms [they] prevented us from obtaining additional litigation funding\u2026this was [Harbour\u2019s] first repudiatory breach\u201d. \u201cthe [2019 Settlement",

I, as the 100% owner of Orb, want it to receive what it is entitled to.\u201d 55 My firm responded to these accusations on 11 May 2023 (pages 452-454): 55.1 confirming that Harbour emphatically den ied any impropriety or breach of any obligations , or that it has caused Dr Cochrane any loss; 55.2 Reiterating the position on Orb\u2019s ownership, referring to the Directed Trial judgment whereby it was held that, notwithstanding Dr Cochrane being the registered shareholder, the shares held in Orb were held as nominee for Dr Smith and therefore, recoverable by the SFO ; and 55.3 Indicating to Dr Cochrane that her correspondence appeared to be a \u201c coordinated attempt by [her], Mr Thomas and Dr Smith to further frustrate the outcome of the Directed Trial\u201d . 56 It is clear to me that from at least April 2023, Dr Cochrane\u2019s intention was to gain control of the assets of the Harbour Trust, as well as the assets of Orb. This is the position she maintains now , albeit premised on the alleged unenforceability of the Harbour IA, rather than the previous allegations of (presumably repudiatory) breache s of the Harbour IA by 21 Harbour. However, as the Court will note, this chain of communications was commenced by Dr Cochrane before the PACCAR Decision was handed down . 57 Following the PACCAR Decision , Dr Cochrane re -commenced correspondence with Harbour, now seeking its agreement to an application to set aside or annul her d\u00e9sastre , and that of Orb, on the ground that they were obtained by Harbour in circumstances where the Harbour IA was an unlawful and/or unenforceable agreement. 58 On numerous occasions during this period, Harbour set out its position to Dr Cochrane in correspondence. By way of example, in a letter of 10 August 2023 (pages 452-453), my firm responded to Dr Cochrane as follows: \u201c5. As to paragraph 7 of your letter, Harbour\u2019s position is as follows: a) The orders made in and in relation to the SFO Proceedings numbered CL -2017- 000323 including the Directed Trial Consequentials Order and the 14 December 2022 Trust and Receivership Order remain valid, binding and enforceable and Harbour will naturally a bide by their terms. b) No party sought to challenge the enforceability of the Investment Agreement at the Directed Trial despite having had the opportunity to do so. Any attempt to do so now would constitute an abuse of the court\u2019s process. c) Your suggestion that the Investment Agreement \u201cwas unlawful from its signature and is unenforceable\u201d is legally misconceived, for various reasons, and is in any case irrelevant given that the underlying issues have already been adjudicated.\u201d 59 On",

Manipulation that has been ongoing for almost 7 years \u201d (pages 457-458). The letter, as well as a letter dated 16 August 2023 (pages 459-460), sought to obtain their consent to support Dr Cochrane\u2019s application to \u201cset aside/ annul\u201d the d\u00e9sastre orders. 60 On 21 August 2023, Dr Cochrane again accused Harbour of \u201c an evolving conspiracy that repetitively breached the Harbour IA terms \u201d, alleging that Harbour \u201c victimised \u201d the funded parties (pages 461- 463). 61 In a letter dated 25 August 2023, Dr Cochrane assert ed that she intended to seek \u201c\u2026compensatory and or restitutionary damages.

On the same day, our firm responded, repeating Harbour\u2019s position that her assertion as to the supposed \u201cmistake\u201d in the drafting of the Consequentials Order was \u201cbaseless and inaccurate\u201d (pages 468-469). 63 Materially similar allegations were made by Dr Cochrane on the next day, 24 October 2023, in relation to the composition of the Non -Arena companies and Orb\u2019s ownership in direct conflict with the Directed Trial Judgment and Consequentials Order, as well as against Harbour of \u201c serial (and most probably repudiatory breaches) of its own agreements terms \u201d (pages 470- 474). The Slip Rule Application 64 Notwithstanding this firm having set out Harbour\u2019s position on the matter in correspondence , Dr Cochrane ultimately filed an application on 10 January 2024 to amend the Consequentials Order purportedly under the \u2018Slip Rule\u2019 to remove Orb from the list of Non -Arena Companies, on the basis that it had been included by mistake when the order was drafted (the \u201c Slip Rule Application \u201d) (pages 475-487). 65 On 15 January 2024, my firm filed written submissions in response to the Slip Rule Application (pages 488-494), arguing that the application should be dismissed for the following reasons: 65.1 Dr Cochrane did not have standing to bring this application, on the basis that she remains subject to d\u00e9sastre in Jersey and is represented by the Viscount; 65.2 The application was without merit ; and 65.3 The application was made by and/or with the support of Dr Smith and his associates, with the aim of frustrating court judgments and orders. All of the previous correspondence purportedly sent by Dr Cochrane bear s the distinctive hallmarks of Dr Smith \u2019s letter -writing style .

Further, Harbour \u2019s submissions referred to a letter of 2 January 2024 which purports to have been sent by Dr 23 Cochrane and Mr Thomas to Susan Dunn of Harbour, Mr Jackson of Quantuma (one of the Joint Liquidators) as well as the managing partner of Stewarts Law, Mr Dench, containing allegations of conspiracy by Harbour, the Joint Liquidators and Stewarts against the Orb Claimants. The metadata on this letter showed that it was drafted by Dr Smith (who is listed as the \u2018author\u2019), rather than by Dr Cochrane. 66 On 17 January 2024, Dr Cochrane responded to Harbour\u2019s submissions by asserting that: \u201c\u2026the Directed Trial did not determine that my ownership of Orb arl was as a nominee for Dr Gerald Smith as paragraph 1 of the Consequentials Order makes clear \u201d (paragraph 4) (pages 495-500). 67 On the same day, Dr Cochrane wrote to the Viscount\u2019s Jersey lawyers, Ogier (pages 501- 503). In particular, she wrote that : \u201cI understand from that advice that at the convening hearing the Royal Court will be asked to make substantive decisions as to whether certain claimants who have filed claims in my d\u00e9sastre process and the d\u00e9sastre process of Orb a.r.l (Orb) are properly t o be treated as creditors. It would be unreasonable to ask the Royal Court to undertake the process of reviewing all the claims with respect to Orb if it is a Non -Arena company.\u201d 68 Shortly thereafter, on 22 January 2024 , Foxton J dismissed the Slip Rule Application on the papers, on the basis that D r Cochrane had no standing , and certified the application itself as being \u201c totally without merit\u201d (\u201cthe Slip Rule Application Ruling \u201d) (pages 504- 505). In his ruling, Foxton J highlighted (inter alia) the following relevant passages of the Directed Trial Judgment (with emphasis added ): \u201c606. Subject to (a) my finding as to the Retained 50% in Bodega (at [503(iv)] above) and (b) any issues which arise as to the effect of the Ozturk No 2 Trust which do not form part of the Directed Trial, I am satisfied that Dr Cochrane held the shares in the Non -Arena Companies as Dr Smith\u2019s nominee. I would note that neither Dr Cochrane nor Dr Smith now seek to challenge this finding, and I am satisfied that it is established on the evidence. In summary: i) Dr Smith has a track record of seeking to disguise his interest in assets behind Dr Cochrane. The investigations brought by the SFO in connection with the Izodia Theft identified a ski chalet held through a corporate vehicle of which Dr Cochrane was a di rector and the transfer of his luxury car collection into Dr Cochrane\u2019s name shortly after the Izodia Theft came to light. 24 ii) Although notionally assetless, Dr Smith has been able to live \u201chigh on the hog\u201d (in his own phrase) off assets notionally owned by Dr Cochrane, spending those assets in accordance with Dr Smith\u2019s idiosyncratic tastes (including a commissioned water clo ck and artwork chosen by Dr Smith) or for his personal benefit (for example on private jet travel, much of which involved Dr Smith travelling alone).

While I accept that much of the money spent by Dr Smith belonged to others, the freedom with which he diss ipated assets notionally in Dr Cochrane\u2019s ownership is relevant when considering whether such interest as Dr Cochrane had in those assets was held in her own right, or as Dr Smith\u2019s nominee. iii) Dr Cochrane has on a number of occasions proclaimed that she is a \u201cbusy GP with two young daughters and no real business experience\u201d, with minimal knowledge of Dr Smith\u2019s business activities. Dr Smith has himself accepted that Dr Cochrane lacked \u201cany independent experience of the world of business, the world of property deals \u201d. The vast network of companies which she apparently owns, and the complex web of dealings in which those companies have engaged, strongly support the suggestion that her involvem ent is nothing more than as a cipher, and that Dr Smith \u2013 with his extensive track -record of complex, contrived and dishonest business dealings \u2013 is \u201ccalling the shots\u201d . iv) Dr Cochrane has no obvious sources of independent wealth from which she might have acquired these assets independently of Dr Smith. In 2005, according to her own evidence, she was close to destitution, and in 2014 and 2016, she gave accounts of her assets and wealth which identified no substantial assets beyond those transferred under the IOM Settlement . v) The confiscation order made against Dr Smith gave him every incentive to hide his ownership of assets behind a nominee owner who he could trust to follow his directions. It is clear that Dr Smith has acted at all times since the Confiscation Order was made with a view to making it appear as if he has no assets \u2013 for example his Deed of Separation with Dr Cochrane of 11 March 2014 sought to give Dr Smith all the benefits o f certain properties, while transferring no property for the SFO to attach. 69 The Slip Rule Application Ruling constituted an unambiguous rejection of Dr Cochrane\u2019s contention that she was entitled to treat Orb\u2019s assets as her own on the basis that Orb was not a Non -Arena Company. By extension, her contention that Orb\u2019s assets should be 25 treated as her own for the purposes of determining her balance sheet solvency is unsustainable . Notwithstanding this definitive ruling (and the Directed Trial Judgment and the LCL Settlement Agreement ), this assertion as to Dr Cochrane\u2019s ownership of Orb was advanced in Dr Cochrane\u2019s Third Affidavit of 11 March 2024 in support of her Amended Representation (pages 348-364) (as described in more detail at paragraph 33 of Appendix 2 below), in which at paragraph 28 she states that she \u201c holds 100% of the shares of Orb a.r.l \u201d (omitting any mention of the findings of the Directed Trial in relation to Orb) and then, at paragraph 35, claims that Orb\u2019s assets are \u201c relevant in calculating [her] balance sheet solvency \u201d.

However, in order to maintain her position in respect of Orb\u2019s recall application, Dr Co chrane now argues that \u201cthe Directed Trial did not determine the ownership of the assets owned by the Non -Arena Companies \u201d, which, for the first time, she now asserts \u201c are held on resulting trust of [sic] the benefit of the Orb Claimants \u201d. (page 1061 ) Dr Cochrane has not yet elucidated how her arguments regarding Orb are to her own benefit, given that she holds no interest in Orb , and it is not a fully accurate statement in any event, given that the IUAs (which the Directed Trial did determine ownership of ) were owned by various Non -Arena Companies . 71 A summary of the background to Dr Cochrane\u2019s Jersey Recall Applications is set out in Appendix 2 to this statement , which has been prepared with the assistance of Harbour\u2019s Jersey lawyers . F. The PACCAR Decision and its relevance to the Harbour IA 72 This Court will be aware of the PACCAR Decision. By way of very brief summary, the Supreme Court found that certain litigation funding agreements fell within the definition of DBAs , for the purposes of the section 58AA of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (\u201cCLSA 1990 \u201d). 73 However, in order to establish if the Harbour IA is in fact a DBA, a thorough analysis is required of the relevant regulatory framework, and of the Harbour IA itself. 26 74 For an agreement to qualify as a damages based agreement, such that it is subject to the DBA Regulations, it must satisfy three requirements (see Section 58AA (3) CLSA 1990 ): 74.1 First, it must be an agreement between a person providing \u201c advocacy services, litigation services or claims management services \u201d and the recipient of those services; 74.2 Second, it must provide for the recipient \u201c to make a payment to the service provider if the recipient obtains a specified financial benefit in connection with the matter in relation to which the services are provided \u201d; and 74.3 Third, the amount of that payment must be \u201c determined by reference to the amount of the financial benefit obtained by the recipient \u201d. 75 My understanding is that the PACCAR Decision revolved principally around the first of these grounds, and established that litigation funders were providers of \u201c claims management services \u201d. Harbour cannot, and does not, dispute this finding or the reasoned conclusions of the Supreme Court before this Court (although it reserves its position in the event that any other point ultimately had to be determined by the Supreme Court) .15 As such, for these purposes Harbour proceeds on the basis that it provides claims management services, and thus the Harbour IA satisfies the first requirement of a DBA according to the CLSA 1990. 76",

This is the basis upon which Harbour and other funders structure their funding agreements, and Harbour will not seek to contend otherwise in respect of the Harbour IA. 77 For the purposes of this statement, I will focus on the third CLSA requirement, namely that a DBA contains provision for a funder\u2019s return which are \u201c determined by reference to the amount of the financial benefit obtained by the recipient \u201d. I understand this to mean, in simple terms, where a funding agreement provides for a funder\u2019s return to be calculat ed by 15 I note, however, that considerable efforts have been made by the legislature to introduce legislation in order to correct this position, which appears not to have been intended by the drafters of the amendment to the CLSA 1990. Unfortunately given the timing of the General Election , it has not yet been possible for this legislation to be passed. While Harbour, alongside others in the funding industry, remain hopeful that such legislation will be introduced, in the intervening period the PACCAR Decision has allowed parties such as Dr Cochrane and others to seek to undermine funding agreements such as the Harbour IA notwithstanding the fact that the funded parties have taken the benefit of the funding . 27 reference to a percentage of the proceeds of the funded action, and it also satisfies the first two criteria set out above, it will meet the definition of a DBA. 78 The Harbour IA , at Schedule 2, contains a mechanism for calculating Harbour\u2019s return in the event that the Orb Claimants succeeded in the funded proceedings, which I extract below (\u201cSchedule 2 \u201d): 79 This tiered structure was agreed in order to account for both the time period of the receipt of any Proceeds, as well as the amount of such proceeds. As I understand it, this again conforms with standard industry practice. The first two rows were agreed to cover the eventuality of an early settlemen t of the funded proceedings, in order to allow for greater 28 recovery by the Orb Claimants in the event that the proceedings were brief. Harbour\u2019s return is therefore based on recovery both on a percentage basis, and by reference to a multiple of its investment. 80 If a funding agreement meets the criteria set out in the CLSA 1990 it is a DBA which must also comply with the requirements of the DBA Regulations , in particular Section 3 of those regulations: 3. The requirements prescribed for the purposes of section 58AA(4)(c) of the Act are that the terms and conditions of a damages -based agreement must specify \u2014 (a) the claim or proceedings or parts of them to which the agreement relates; (b) the circumstances in which the representative\u2019s payment, expenses and costs, or part of them, are payable; and (c) the reason for setting the amount of the payment at the level agreed, which, in an employment matter,",

No such reasons are set out in the Harbour IA. As such, again, Harbour does not conten d that the Harbour IA meets the requirements of the DBA Regulations. I note that the Minister of State responsible for piloting the DBA Regulations through Parliament, Lord McNally, followed up questions on the draft regulations in Grand Committee with a formal written response to Lord Beecham on 5 March 20 13 (pages 50 6-510), shortly before they were promulgated on 1 April 2013 . He stated that: \u201c The DBA Re gulations update the 2010 regulations, and take account of recommendations made by the Civil Justice Council (CJC) .\u201d 82 The CJC\u2019s position had been set out in a letter dated 24 October 2012 to the Ministry of Justice (pages 5 11-514) in the context of the statutory consultation required under LASPO , which was also extended to non -statutory stakeholders . Among the CJC\u2019s recommendations had been a proposed amendment to the information required to be given to a client entering a DBA , which referred to the availability of other methods of financing the claim or financing the proceedings. The CJC suggested the addition of third 29 party litigation funding into the list, reflecting its view that this was a type of alternative to a DBA, not a DBA itself , and that the Government was not consulting on the basis that litigation funding agreements would be subject to the regulations . 83 The CJC\u2019s suggestion was not taken up. However, in Lord McNally\u2019s letter, u nder the heading \u201cThird party litigation funding\u201d he expressly stated on behalf of the Government : The matter was debated at some length during the passage of the LASPO Act through Parliament. Some colleagues were concerned about the future growth of third party litigation funding arrangements and, in particular, a move into personal injury claims. While there was a call for the introduction of statutory regulation, the Government does not believe this is the right course of action at this stage: rather this is an issue that we are keeping under review and we will not hesitate to act should we need to do so in the future. G. The LCL Settlement Agreement and the 2014 Harbour Deed 84 As outlined above, on 27 January 2021, shortly after the Directed Trial commenced , Dr Smith, Dr Cochrane and other Smith Parties entered into the LCL Settlement Agreement . 85 The relevant terms of this agreement are: 85.1 Paragraph 3 \u201cThe LCL Parties hereby release, discharge and waive (and agree to treat as released, discharged and waived in all respects and for all purposes) all and any actions, claims, rights, demands and set-offs, whether capable of being litigated or enforced in t his jurisdiction or any other, whether presently known or unknown to",

Indeed, shortly after the conclusion of the Directed Trial, on 9 August 2021, my firm received a letter from Mr Spragg of Keystone Law, solicitors to Litigation Capital Limited (\u201c LCL \u201d)16, arguing that Harbour did not succeed at the Directed Trial and therefore the LCL Settlement Agreement had \u201c no continuing force or effect \u201d (page 515). We responded on 12 August 2021, refuting this assertion. Mr Spragg responded on 16 August 2021, noting (without explanation) that: \u2022 \u201cThe judgement awarded all the assets to the Orb Claimants, \u2022 The LCL parties\u2019 \u2013 SPs parties\u2019 agreement was conditional and between themselves. It did not include the Orb Claimants, \u2022 LCL did not release the Orb Claimants \u201d (pages 516-517). 87 The background to LCL \u2019s involvement in these proceedings is well known to the Court and I will not rehearse it in detail here. In short, LCL is a vehicle of the Smith Parties, and at various times Dr Cochrane, Mr Taylor and Mr Anthony Smith (Dr Smith\u2019s brother) 16 On 24 November 2021 , we received an email from an \u2018Admin LCL\u2019 proton mail account attaching a document headed \u2018Notice of Change\u2019 which stated that Keystone Law no longer acted for LCL and that LCL would be acting in person. 32 have been its directors. I n the circumstances, therefore , Mr Spragg\u2019s correspondence was sent in the interests (and most likely at the direction) of Dr Smith, Dr Cochrane and Messrs Thomas and Taylor , who , as early as two months after the Consequentials Order was made, were already putting into motion plans to prevent the Settlement Parties from enforcing the rights they had established at the Directed Trial. While no party has formally sought to challenge the validity of the LCL Settlement Agreement, sever al of the Smith Parties have acted in clear breach of its terms. I summarise several such acts below, and refer to further details which are set out in Appendix 1: 87.1 Mr Thomas appears to have colluded with LCL in relation to its efforts in the Republic of the Marshall Islands to frustrate the efforts of the Enforcement Receivers, in contravention of LCLs\u2019 obligations under the LCL Settlement Agreement and the LCL Disco ntinuance Order. In doing so, Mr Thomas incited a clear breach of the LCL Discontinuance",

In doing so, Mr Thomas incited a clear breach of the LCL Discontinuance Order by LCL. The Enforcement Receivers commenced contempt proceedings against Mr Thomas, which were ultimately discontinued when Mr Thomas corrected the position. 87.2 Dr Smith directly committed numerous breaches of the LCL Settlement Agreement by impeding the Enforcement Receivers\u2019 attempts to manage and realise assets to which Harbour is entitled pursuant to the Directed Trial Judgment, namely the Hamilton House properties; 87.3 Dr Cochrane breached her obligations under the LCL Settlement Agreement by impeding the efforts of the Enforcement Receivers to manage and realise properties in Spain, which ultimately led to the ruling of 18 April 2024 to which I refer below. 88 In the case of Dr Cochrane, as I outline above, the release of claims under the LCL Settlement is directly relevant to the Jersey Recall Applications . This is because Dr Cochrane has asserted proprietary rights over Orb (which also disregards the outcome of the Directed Trial) , as well as listing within her estate various properties to which she has waived any rights by way of the LCL Settlement Agreement . 89 Although this will be a matter for development in submissions, Harbour\u2019s position is that the release and waiver given by Dr Cochrane and the other Smith Parties under the LCL Settlement Agreement is broad and (as set out above) extends to, among other things: \u201call 33 and any actions, claims, rights, demands and set -offs, whether capable of being litigated or enforced in this jurisdiction or any other, whether presently known or unknown to the Parties or to the law, and whether arising in law or equity, under statute or otherwise, that they have, had, may have or hereafter can or shall or may subsequently acquire \u2026\u201d 90 The LCL Settlement Agreement also contains no -contest clauses. I would respectfully suggest that , taken as a whole, the LCL Settlement Agreement precludes Dr Cochrane from seeking to ventilate the arguments that she does in relation to the effect of PACCAR on the Directed Trial Judgment and the Harbour IA in the Jersey Proceedings \u2013 she has agreed to a full settlement and is no longer entitled to seek to go behind Harbour\u2019s entitlements. 91 As I explain above, while LCL (and thus, undoubtedly, Dr Smith) questioned the validity and enforceability of the LCL Settlement Agreement, Dr Cochrane has not formally advanced this position, as far as Harbour is aware . Instead, in her Jersey Recall Applications she has sought simply to ignore it. As the Court is aware, however, the issue of the validity of the LCL Settlement Agreement (and more specifically the LCL Discontinuance Order) came before the Court earlier this year and has been determined . 92 While Harbour was not directly involved, I am aware of a ruling in these proceedings given on 18 April 2024 (the \u201c LCL Undertakings Ruling \u201d) (pages 518-519). I understand the context of this ruling is complex, and relates to efforts made by the Enforcement Receivers to carry out their duties to realise certain assets in Spain, which Dr Cochrane has incorrectly asserted belong to the Orb Claimants.

I understand the context of this ruling is complex, and relates to efforts made by the Enforcement Receivers to carry out their duties to realise certain assets in Spain, which Dr Cochrane has incorrectly asserted belong to the Orb Claimants. As set out above and further explained in Appendix 1, Dr Cochrane has impeded the efforts of the Enforcement Rec eivers, in direct contravention of the undertakings she gave in the LCL Discontinuance Order, which reflect Dr Cochrane\u2019s obligations pursuant to the LCL Settlement Agreement, and which are accompanied by a penal notice. 93 My understanding is that the LCL Undertakings Ruling\u2019s effect was to confirm the binding nature of the undertakings contained within the LCL Discontinuance Order. As such, I respectfully suggest that Dr Cochrane\u2019s obligations under the LCL Settlement Agree ment remain valid and binding and that the Court has already finally determined this question . 94 I also note that the LCL Undertakings Ruling contained the following finding at paragraph 12: 34 \u201cDr Cochrane has no standing to act in any form of trustee capacity on behalf of the Orb Claimants, still less to take decisions intended to give Dr Smith (who is not an Orb Claimant) the use of any assets .\u201d 95 I consider it likely that Dr Cochrane\u2019s Jersey Recall Applications are being conducted with the assistance, and likely at the direction of Dr Smith, who seeks to regain control of the property which is within Dr Cochrane and Orb\u2019s d\u00e9sastres . 96 On the basis of the foregoing, I respectfully ask the Court to grant the relief sought by Harbour in reliance upon the LCL Settlement Agreement, as set out at paragraph 5.1 above. 97 A second issue arising from an agreement affects both Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas, to the extent that they might otherwise be able to attack the Harbour IA on the basis of the PACCAR Decision. The 2014 Harbour Deed was signed from October 2014 onwards, and postdated the receipt of the assets under the IOM Settlement. Each of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas (amongst others) agreed that the recoveries under the IOM Settlement were to be treated as \u201cProceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings\u201d for the purposes of Cl 9.1 of the Harbour IA and were to be applied in accordance with the terms of that clause. Accordingly, each of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas are estopped by deed from contesting that position. In addition, the 2014 Harbour Deed is on any view not a DBA \u2013 it no longer relates to a future contingency, but regulates the effect of an event that had by that stage already happened. H. The abusive nature of the Smith Parties\u2019 attempt to seek to invalidate the Harbour IA 98 Harbour's position is that the Orb Claimants could have argued that the Harbour IA was a DBA and sought to undermine Harbour\u2019s entitlement under the agreement at any time after it was agreed (although possibly not immediately) . The DBA Regulations entered into force on 1 April 2013, and the Harbour IA was executed on 10 July 2013. As set out above, it is accepted that at that point, not even the Government believed that the DBA Regulations were going to apply to litigation funding agreements. 99 The litigation which gave rise to the PACCAR Decision (the \u201c Trucks Dispute \u201d) arose in the Competition Appeals Tribunal (the \u201c CAT \u201d).

It is not necessary for me to explain the background to those proceedings, save that the hearing in front of the CAT at which the issue of whether litigation funding agreements were Damages Based Agreements took 35 place from 4 to 6 June 2019 (the \u201c Trucks Judgment (Funding)17\u201d). The Trucks Judgment (Funding) was handed down on 28 October 2019 , and subsequently the same arguments regarding the status of litigation funding agreements were ventilated before the Court of Appeal in relation to an application by the defendants in the Trucks Dispute for permission to appeal or alternatively for permission to bring proceedings for judicial review, a decision which was handed down on 5 March 2021 ( Paccar Inc. v RHA and UKTC [2021] EWCA Civ 299 (the \u201c PACCAR Court of Appeal Decision \u201d)).18 100 Both of these decisions made it clear that arguments about the status of litigation funding agreements at DBAs were \u2018live\u2019 and had been published in high profile judgments since late 2019. Both the Trucks Judgment (Funding) and the PACCAR Court of Appeal Decision also refer to an article published in the Cambridge Law Journal in 2014, by Professor Rachel Mulheron , title d \u201cEngland's unique approach to the self -regulation of third party funding: a critical analysis of recent developments \u201d (the \u201c Mulheron Analysis\u201d)19 (pages 520-553). The Mulheron Analysis, in my view , contains a thorough breakdown of the primary arguments which would, several years later, be advanced by the defendant parties in the lead up to the Trucks Judgment (Funding) , and later by those same parties in their application to the Supreme Court . 101 In particular, Prof. Mulheron expends several pages on a detailed analysis of question of whether litigation funders, according t o the rules of statutory interpretation, provide \u201c claims management services \u201d, as defined in section 58AA of the CLSA 1990. While she concedes that the drafting of the relevant provisions may give rise to a degree of uncertainty, she concludes that \u201cthe author considers that any application which sought to render a LFA unenforceable because it did not meet the requirements of the DBA Regulations 2013 would be bound to fail. \u201d Professor Mulheron also noted that the possibility that funding agreements were caug ht by the DBA Regulations 2013 had been \u201c ventured in some quarters since the implementation of the 17 https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/CAT/2019/26.html 18 https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/2021/299.html , at paragraph 80(2) \u201cThe Tribunal next pointed out that the argument now advanced by DAF \"is not altogether novel\": see [37]. In particular, the issue was raised by Professor Rachel Mul heron, who is \"one of the leading academics in the field of civil procedure\", in an influent ial article in the Cambridge Law Journal in 2014: see England's unique approach to the self regulation of third party funding: a critical analysis of recent developments [2014] CL J 570 at 592-595. Although Professor Mulheron considered the argument to be i ncorrect, she suggested that for the sake of clarity the legislation should be amended .\u201d 19 [2014] C.L.J. 570, 590 -96. 36 DBA Regulations 2013 \u201d.20 The author also notes that the debate \u201c has been the subject",

The Supreme Court in PACCAR simply confirmed this position. That the point had not been judicially considered before is irrelevant: Professor Rachel Mulheron (whose views the litigation funders will be well aware) first raised the point almost a decade ago.\u201d 104 Despite Professor Mulheron\u2019s conclusions, she and those working with her clearly remained concerned that greater clarity was required in this area, and undertook to engage with the Civil Justice Council on a consultation called the Damages Based Agreements Reform Project, the conclusions of which were published in August 2015 (the \u201c CJC DBA Report \u201d).22 The aim of this consultation was to make recommendations to the government regarding revisions to the DBA Regulations 2013, with a view to the enactment of the DBA Regulations 2015. 105 In the event, the DBA Regulations 2015 were never adopted. However, noting that while \u201cit was extremely unlikely that Third Party Funders were inadvertently covered by the 2013 DBA Regulations \u2026 the intent of the Ministry of Justice to set any remote residual uncertainty about the point at nought was noted \u201d. The authors recommended specifically excluding litigation funders in the revised report. 20 Mulheron Analysis, page 3, paragraph 1 21 Ibid, footnote 140 22 https://www.judiciary.uk/wp -content/uploads/2015/09/dba -reform -project -cjc-aug-2015.pdf 37 106 I note that until mid-2016 , the Orb Claimants were represented by Stewarts Law, a firm with a very detailed understanding of litigation funding, and who were no doubt aware of the principles I outline above. It is also evident to me, however, that the Orb Claimants would have had n o commercial interest seeking to undermine the Harbour IA while they were represented by Stewarts. Harbour complied with the Harbour IA fully and provided the Orb claimants with around \u00a35.2m of litigation funding. 107 However, despite the deterioration of the relationship between the Orb Claimants and Harbour, which ultimately resulted in Harbour successfully establishing its rights under the Harbour IA at the Directed Trial, neither the Orb Claimants nor any other party sought to take up the argument that the Harbour IA was unenforceable on the basis that it was a DBA that did not comply with the DBA Regulations 2013",

Their opportunities to do so were extremely extensive, given the lengthy nature of these proceedings. I set out at Annex 1 a timetable of the relevant procedural steps in these proceedings. This clearly shows that the Orb Claimants have had numerous opportunities to advance an argument as to the enforceability of the Harbour IA , from mid-2017 (when the first \u201c assets and claims position papers\u201d were produced by the parties, including the Orb Claimants) until July 2021 when the opportunity to appeal the Consequentials Order expired. 108 In particular, the Orb Claimants had multiple opportunities during the lead up to the Directed Trial to advance claims in respect of the validity of the Harbour IA , including : 108.1 Five C ase Management Conference ( CMC ) hearings. The purpose of three of those CMCs was to establish the scope of assets and issues to be determined at the Directed Trial. 108.2 Pursuant to court order s, at least three requirements for parties to file statements outlining their position, including by way of a statement of case or position paper, and consequential amendments to the same. Applications to amend parties\u2019 pleadings were being made as late as 31 December 2020 following the PTR , at which time LCL (one of the Smith Parties) applied to amend its statement of case. 108.3 Witness statements of fact, both trial witness statements and those in respect of interlocutory applications such as, for example , the guillotine hearing that culminated in the assets being identified as the subject matter of the Directed Trial. 38 108.4 The Directed Trial itself, which spanned 7 weeks, represented a significant opportunity for the Orb Claimants to advance their position. It should be noted that during the trial period, extensive submissions on a wide range of issues were put forward by numerous parties to the litigation , in some instances for the first time. No stone was left unturned, and all matters raised were exhaustively deliberated. 109 I note also that Harbour\u2019s Statement of Case in these proceedings of 29 November 2017 stated at paragraph 7 that \u201c Harbour intends to rely upon the Harbour Funding Agreement in these proceedings for its full terms and true effect \u201d. It went on at paragraph 15 to state that \u201c Harbour entered into the Harbour Funding Agreement in good faith, in the ordinary course of business and on ordinary terms (including terms as to its remuneration and success fee )\u2026\u201d. 110 In response, Messrs Thomas and Taylor in their Responsive Statement of Case of 28 July 2019 , at paragraph 24, stated that \u201c These Respondents accept a s accurate in all material respects the summary of the Harbour Funding Agreement given in paragraphs 5 to 16 of Harbour\u2019s Statement of Case dated 29 November 2017\u2026 \u201d 111 It is notable that t he SFO\u2019s responsive statement of case of 12 June 2018 stated at paragraph 13 that \u201c Harbour is required to prove paragraphs 15 and 16 [of its Statement of Case] .

The Viscount supports Harbour\u2019s case in relation to the Harbour Funding Agreement at paras 55 -65 of her SOC \u2026. 8. As for the contentions advanced by certain other Interested Parties in relation to the Harbour Funding Agreement : a. It is noted t hat no Interested Party challenges the validity of the Harbour Funding Agreement \u2026\u201d 113 It is clear that the validity and enforceability of the Harbour IA was relied upon by Harbour from the outset of these proceedings, and that no party chose to actively challenge Harbour\u2019s position. It is entirely unsurprising, therefore, that the Directed Trial did not need expressly to confirm that status . 39 114 Accordingly, the Smith Parties have had ample opportunities to argue that the Harbour IA was subject to the DBA regulations and failed to do so. I would respectfully suggest that these matters are res judicata, or give rise to cause of action or issue estoppel, or that it would be abusive , for reasons that will be expanded upon in submissions, for them to be allowed to do so now. I. The Severability of the Harbour IA 115 Given the PACCAR Decision , if the above points do not determine the matter in Harbour\u2019s favour, there appears to be a risk that the Harbour IA would be found by a court to be a non -compliant DBA. I note, however, that t he Harbour IA also includes a clause headed \u201cSeverability\u201d, which provides that: \u201cIf any term or provision in this Agreement shall in whole or in part be held to any extent to be illegal or unenforceable under any enactment or rule of law, that term or provision or part shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement a nd the enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected \u201d. 116 It is my understanding that the percentage -based recovery provisions in Schedule 2 are capable of being severed , such that the agreement remains enforceable . I do not seek to make submissions in this witness statement as to the legal position in respect of sever ability . However I will , for the Court\u2019s convenience, set out below my understanding of how this would operate in practice. 117 Harbour\u2019s entitlement in respect of any proceeds up to \u00a340 million is calculated on a n alternative basis , depending on when such proceeds are received. In respect of this agreement, the initial period in respect of proceeds received either 6 or 12 months after the agreement was signed, expired in 10 July 201 3, over 10 years ago. 118 The final two rows are intended to determine Harbour\u2019s recoveries if the proceeds exceed \u00a340 million, and are calculated on a percentage basis only.

It is also worth noting, although not a necessary factor in this exercise, that Harbour does not expect the proceeds to exceed \u00a340 million , indeed they are likely to be significantly less , not least because the costs of the relevant office holders charged with realising the assets have been significantly inflated by the actions of the Smith Parties since the Di rected Trial . 40 119 As long ago as 2 July 2021, not long after the Directed Trial Judgment, my firm wrote to Messrs Thomas and Taylor setting out the likely proceeds, including estimated values of the relevant assets (which are now signifi cantly out of date, and which are likely to be significantly reduced as at today\u2019s date) (pages 556-563). We also made it clear that Harbour expected its minimum return to be calculated on the basis of the multiples included in Schedule 2. It should be noted that the Orb Claimants (Messrs Tho mas and Taylor in particular) have on several occasions asserted that they expect the proceeds to be considerably more than \u00a340 million. In any event , I respectfully suggest that such dispute is not material at this stage. 120 It is Harbour\u2019s belief that the sections of Schedule 2 which contain a percentage based recovery can be severed from the Harbour IA, to the extent that they are \u201cillegal or unenforceable\u201d , in accordance with the severability provisions of the agreement . This is a straightforward exercise in contractual in terpretation which does not require reference to the general common law principles concerning severance , or to satisfy th e general common law test . In particular , in the contractual interpretation context the court is not limited to deletions, it does not matter whether there is surplus language left over and there is no need to consider whether the overall balance of the contract remains the sa me. 121 However, Harbour also intends to argue in the alternative that the general common law test can be satisfied in any event . I set out below another version of Schedule 2 which demonstrates where such modifications are necessary (the \u201c Modified Schedule 2 \u201d). I note also that in pre -action correspondence, having received the draft of this Application, Marriot Harrison has indicated that Mr Thomas disagrees with Harbour application of the principles of severability in respect of the proposed Modified Schedule 2. These objections would only appear to have application to the common law approach not the exercise in contractual interpretation referred to above. Harbour reserves its position in this regard, including as to the further modification of Schedule 2 and any arguments about how the surviving wording may be interpreted , pending receipt of Mr Thomas\u2019s responsive evidence. 41 122 It is my understanding that, for severance to be possible at common law , three requirements must be satisfied: 122.1 First, it must be possible to remove the offending language without adding to or modifying other language (known as the \u201c Blue Pencil Test\u201d)23; 122.2 Second, the resulting contract must be supported by adequate consideration; and 23 Harbour reserves its position, should the matter go on appeal to the Supreme Court, as to whether the requirements of the Blue",

In fact, they read as plain English, as if the severed provisions had never been included. The nature of the agreement has not changed . 124 The only other passage in the Harbour IA which refers to Harbour\u2019s entitlement to a percentage of proceeds is contained within Clause 10 .2(e): \u201c10.2 Where, pursuant to clause 4.2(i), the Claimants receive a recommendation from the Legal Representatives to accept an offer of Settlement made on behalf of one or more Defendants (the \"Recommended Offer\") but the Claimants elect to reject the Recommended Offer, if the Proceeds eventually recovered from such Defend ant or Defendants are less than the amount of the Recommended Offer, the Claimants shall hold such Proceeds on bare Trust absolutely for the benefit of HF2 and the Claimants and to the extent of their interests as Trust Beneficiaries The Claimants shall ad ditionally keep such Proceeds separate from the Claimants' own funds and shall apply the Proceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings in the following order upon receipt of such Proceeds: (a) deduct all stamp duties, bank charges and currency exchange costs payable by the Claimants relating to or arising out of any such Success in the Proceedings; (b) pay to HF2 the HF2 Investment; (c) pay any other sums due in respect of Claimants' Legal Costs; (d) pay to the Legal Representatives, Barristers or other third parties with whom the Claimants have concluded a Legal Costs Agreement any success fee or costs uplift payable under any such Legal Costs Agreement; (e) pay to HF2 any amount due to it in its capacity as Trust Beneficiary pursuant to Schedule 2 save that the percentage of Proceeds payable to HF2 shall be calculated by reference to the amount of the Recommended Offer and not by reference to the amount o f the Proceeds; and 43 (f) pay to the Claimants any remaining amount which the Claimants shall receive in their capacity as Trust Beneficiaries .\u201d 125 All that is required in this section of the agreement is the deletion of the second half of Clause 10.2(e), from the words \u201c save that \u201d to the end of the clause and in any event Clause 10.2(e) has no relevance to the current situation . Again , the balance of the clause remains entirely coherent , without any further amendments necessary. 126 I note that the Thomas Letter Before Action also refers to the provisions of Clause 14 of the Harbour IA . I understand the implication of the letter to be that , according to Mr Thomas, Clause 14.4(a)(ii) of the Harbour IA also contains provisions that cause Harbour\u2019s return to be \u201cdetermined by reference to the amount",

Again , the balance of the clause remains entirely coherent , without any further amendments necessary. 126 I note that the Thomas Letter Before Action also refers to the provisions of Clause 14 of the Harbour IA . I understand the implication of the letter to be that , according to Mr Thomas, Clause 14.4(a)(ii) of the Harbour IA also contains provisions that cause Harbour\u2019s return to be \u201cdetermined by reference to the amount of the financial benefit obtained by the recipient \u201d, in accordance with the third of the DBA requirements of the CLSA 1990. However, I do not believe this to be the case (and again it has no relevance to the current situation) . 127 Clause 14 .4 reads as follows: \u201c14.4 In the event that the Claimants continue with the Proceedings after the Termination Date and the Claimants subsequently Succeed in such Proceedings, the Claimants agree on a joint and several basis that: (a) they will hold all Proceeds on bare Trust absolutely for the Claimants and HF2 and to the extent of their interests as Trust Beneficiaries, such Proceeds will be kept separate from the Claimants' own funds and the Claimants shall as trustee of the Trus t forthwith pay to HF2 an amount from the Proceeds corresponding to: (i) the HF2 Investment up to the Termination Date; and (ii) a sum calculated by applying 10% per annum on the amounts referred to in subclause 14.4(a)(i), calculated from the date of each payment out (or assumption of liability for Adverse Costs) by HF2 to the date of refund to HF2 by the Claimants. (b) The provisions of clauses 8 and 9 and payment to HF2 under the Trust, will apply as if this Agreement had continued in force, SAVE THAT the amount of Proceeds payable to HF2 under Schedule 2 shall be fixed by reference to the Termination Date and not t he date of receipt of monies by HF2 following Success in the Proceedings; and 44 (c) the Claimants shall not be obliged to make payments to HF2 under the terms of this Trust that are more than the Proceeds it recovers. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause 14.4 shall survive any termination of this Agreement .\u201d 128 Although the Thomas Letter Before Action does not clearly set out the basis of Mr Thomas\u2019s assertion in relation to this provision, I assume that Mr Thomas\u2019s case is that a reference in 14.4(a)(ii) to a sum of 10% per annum due to Harbour renders this clause a DBA provision in that by its nature a percentage is determined by to a separate figure. However, the figure which determines the amount of the percentage due in this instance is Harbour\u2019s investment, rather than the amount of any proceeds. This is eff ectively a provision for Harbour to recover interest on its investment in the instance that the Harbour IA is terminated before proceeds are received by the Orb Claimants. Therefore by definition , if this clause were to be invoked, the Orb Claimants would have not yet received any financial benefit for Harbour\u2019s return to be calculated by reference to. I do not understand the third criterion of the CLSA 1990 to be intended to refer to this scenario, therefore there is no need to consider the severance of this provision. 129 Finall y, I also understand Mr Thom as to intend to argue that the provisions of part of Clause 9 of the Harbour IA would render the agreement a DBA, specifically Clause 9.3.

Mr Thomas\u2019s position has not been made completely clear in correspondence , and as such Harbour reserves its position and will respond more fully in due course if necessary . 130 As to the second requirement of the severability test , which is that the resulting contract should still be supported by adequate consideration, I would respectfully suggest that this would be satisfied. Harbour would still be providing consideration by way of its promise to provide funding to the Orb Claimants (and the provision of funding) , and the Orb Claimants would be providing consideration by way of their promise to hold on trust the Proceeds on Success, and to pay to Harbour, out of those proceeds, (1) the amount of the investment and (2) a return, calculated now as a multiple of Harbour\u2019s investment . 131 As to the third requirement (that the nature of the agreement should not be altered such that it becomes quite different to that originally agreed), as I outline above, the Harbour IA only requires amend ment in very limited respects . The essence of the agreement remains unchanged , namely that Harbour agree d to fund the Orb Claimants in exchange 45 for a return should Proceeds be recovered. The potential change in Harbour\u2019s entitlement is a matter of degree, and not a change in the inherent commercial nature of the agreement . 132 In the alternative, Harbour\u2019s case will be that at a bare minimum, its contractual right to repayment of the investment (plus interest at 10% per annum as stipulated in clause 17.1 of the Harbour IA )24 remains unimpaired. This is specified in Cl 9.1(b) , and is unaffected by any finding that the return elements of the Harbour IA are unenforceable. 133 I note that the severance approach is not the only available analysis of how to deal with statutory unenforceability. It will be a matter of submission as to whether it is the correct framework within which to assess the issue, as opposed, by way of example only, to an interpretation of the Harbour IA which locates the DBA within a confined portion of the larger whole and which does not have effects outside of that portion. 134 Finally, Mr Thomas has suggested that even if Harbour\u2019s case on severa nce succeeds, the resulting agreement must somehow conform to the requirements of the CLSA 1990. Mr Thomas has not explained this principle and as such it would be premature for Harbour\u2019s position to be fully developed here. That said , Harbour would consider the starting point to be that if the Harbour IA is no t a DBA following one of the approaches as set out above , it is not required to meet any criteria set out in S.58AA of the CLSA 1990. J. Harbour\u2019s detrimental reliance on the Harbour IA 135 Harbour has detrimentally relied upon its understanding that the Harbour IA was an enforceable agreement which conferred upon it particular proprietary rights . In these proceedings, as I note above, H arbour funded the Orb Claimants in the amount of approximately \u00a35.2 million, and has since spent several times that amount enforcing its rights under the Harbour IA. 136",

In these proceedings, as I note above, H arbour funded the Orb Claimants in the amount of approximately \u00a35.2 million, and has since spent several times that amount enforcing its rights under the Harbour IA. 136 In total, Harbour has expended approximately \u00a3 16.7 million (including amounts advanced by Harbour to the Viscount) as of the date of this evidence , and expects to expend considerably more on dealing with further actions which have been initiated by the Smith Parties.

These represent only a partial picture of the total costs that those parties have expended , as they reflected only their legal costs incurred during the Directed Trial , i.e. to 2021 . These totals have undoubtedly increased significantly in the subsequent years (including a total of around \u00a31.16 million expended by the Settlement Parties in the context of the Part 8 Claim). 137.1 Stewarts Law: \u00a32.3 million 137.2 The Viscount: \u00a32.5 million 137.3 The SFO: \u00a31.8 million 137.4 The Joint Liquidators: \u00a33.4 million 137.5 The Enforcement Receivers: \u00a33.8 million K. Limitation 138 Harbour will also submit that, as determined in the Directed Trial, Harbour\u2019s right to recovery under the Harbour IA was engaged (at the latest) on 29 April 2016, at the time of execution of a settlement between Dr Smith, Dr Cochrane and Mr Andrew Ruhan (t he \u201cGeneva Settlement \u201d) (the Confidential Deed, which is one of the Geneva Settlement documents is at pages 564-568), which brought to an end the Orb Litigation (which was itself dismissed by way of consent order on 5 May 2016). 139 As such, the time period for the Orb Claimants to contend that the Harbour IA was unenforceable began at the date of the Geneva Settlement, and ended in April 2022, well after the conclusion of the Directed Trial, and during the period in which the Orb Claimants\u2019 c hallenges to the Directed Trial Judgment were well underway. 140 Harbour\u2019s limitation submissions will be developed in due course, but I also note here that, as I set out above, the potential arguments regarding the applicability of the DBA Regulations 2013 to the Harbour IA were publicly available since around the time of the Mulheron Analysis in 2014. As such, the Orb Claimants could have discovered the basis 47 for their potential cause of action at any time from that point in 2014 onwards, and certainly by April 2016. 141 For the purposes of this evidence, I have sought to apply a convention al 6-year limitation period.

This reservation also extends to Harbour\u2019s right to argue that Mr Thomas is barred by laches from obtaining the relief he seeks , in the circumstances of this case, whether or not a limitation period applies to the relief he seeks . 142 Finally, in pre -action correspondence, Marriott Harrison has indicated that Mr Thomas intends to argue that should his action be time barred, the same should apply to this application by Harbour. Harbour\u2019s position will be developed in submission in due course, but I note that this appears to be a misconceived interpretation of the relief sought by Harbour in this application. Primarily, Harbour seeks declaration s that Mr Thomas, Dr Cochrane or any other party\u2019s actions to undermine the Harbour IA are abusi ve or incorrect, and only if Harbour does not succeed on those grounds, that those parties\u2019 applications are time -barred in terms of advancing the substantive arguments . L. Dr Cochrane\u2019s standing and the Debarring/Stay Directions 143 As she was declared en d\u00e9sastre in November 2016 , Dr Cochrane\u2019s personal interests in these proceedings have been represented by the Viscount . I note, however, that Dr Cochrane executed the LCL Settlement Deed in her personal capacity. 144 In the circumstances, without prejudice to its rights more generally, Harbour is prepared to take a pragmatic position and would not object to Dr Cochrane being permitted to address the Court on the matters dealt with in this application . 145 Given th e Thomas Letter Before Action, it seems that Mr Thomas is likely to seek to oppose Harbour\u2019s application and seek relief that is relevant to the other Orb Claimants as well as himself . In this regard, Harbour \u2019s position is that Mr Thomas remains bound by and must comply , in full, with the terms of the Debarring/Stay Directions before any application or request for relief he makes can proceed.

These include, for example : (a) whether the Guarantee entered into between Harbour and Dr Cochrane renders Dr Cochrane liable for any unenforceable obligations under the Harbour IA in any event , and whether Harbour can hold Dr Cochrane, Mr Thomas and Mr Taylor liable for breach of the represe ntations and warranties at Cl 3.1(g) of the Harbour IA under which they promised that the obligations assumed were \u201clegal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations\u201d in the amount of any reduction to Harbour\u2019s entitlement ; (b) whether Harbour can nevertheless uphold its rights on alternative bases, such as proprietary estoppel, constructive or resulting trusts, unjust enrichment or equitable allowance , or the survival of the Harbour Trust even in the event that the Harbour IA",

(\u201c Casa Coloniches \u201d) Dr Cochrane Dr Cochrane has been consistently non -cooperative regarding the transfer of the share of Casa Coloniches , a Non Arena Company over whose shares the the Enforcement Receivers are appointed. Her actions include initially refusing to sign transfer documents for the shares, initially refusing to appoint the Enforcement Receivers as directors and sign other documents and indicating an intention to oppose the Attorney General of Jersey's representation to vary the saisie judiciaire made by the Royal Court of Jersey on 24 November 2016 to permit the transfer of shares in Casa Coloniches to the Enforcement Receivers which has caused, and continues to cause, significant delay and cost.25 Ongoing (from February 2021) Obstruction by associates of Smith in bringing claims against companies controlled by the Enforcement Receivers and opposing the recognition of the Enforcement Receivers and Directed Trial Judgment in proceedings in the Republic of the Marshall Islands Smith parties and Thomas In February 2021, Simon Cooper and Simon McNally commenced claims against SMA and GACH (both Non -Arena Companies) in the Republic of the Marshall Islands which the Enforcement Receivers on behalf of SMA and GACH opposed. In April 2021, the Enforcement Rece ivers applied for recognition of their appointment. In June 2021, LCL sought to consent to a claim brought by Cooper and McNally that includer a transfer of the shares of the Non Arena Companies (determined in the Directed Trial to be held for Dr Smith and payable to Confiscation Order) to SMA and GACH, which the Smith parties (including Mr Thomas) claimed were not controlled by the Enforcement Receivers but by Thomas or entities connected with them. In November 2021, Minardi Investments Limited (then actin g by Smith associates) brought a further claim against SMA (acting by the Enforcement Receivers).

Despite notice being given to them by the Enforcement Receivers , vacant possession was actively resisted, including by way of court applications, causing significant cost and delay. As noted above, despite vacant possession having ultimately been obtained by the Enforcement Receivers, Dr Smith has again claimed rights over these properties, as a result of the PACCAR decision. 11 May 2022 Part 8 Claim commenced by Messrs Thomas and Taylor by which they sought to appoint Mr Ticehurst as trustee of the Harbour Trust for an improper purpose \u201cthe Part 8 Claim \u201d) Thomas As part of their efforts to frustrate the Directed Trial, Messrs Thomas and Taylor (with the support and funding of Smith and his associates) sought to enforce certain rights as trustees of the trust arising out of the Harbour Investment Agreement by way of a Part 8 claim . Despite a previous indication from Foxton J that Messrs Thomas and Taylor were not suitable trustees, given their prior unlawful receipt of trust funds, they acted in direct contravention of the Judge\u2019s indications by both seeking to act as trustees, and by improperly appointing a further trustee (Mr Ticehurst) . After a further trial which took place in late 2022, again in front of Foxton J, Messrs Thomas and Taylor were found to have been acting in concert with Smith and against the interests of the principal beneficiaries of the Harbour Trust, and were removed as trustees. All of Messrs Thomas and Taylors\u2019 arguments failed, the Settlement Parties were forced to incur significant additional costs of over \u00a31m, and the additional litigation caused a significant delay in the ongoing enforcement efforts of the Office Holders. 20 June 2022 Contempt Application against Mr Thomas The Enforcement Receivers filed a contempt application against Mr Thomas28 on the following grounds: \u2022 Inciting LCL to purport to transfer its shares in SMA and GACH to the \u201cjoint trustees of the Orb Claimants Trust \u201d; \u2022 Purporting to accept board appointments for SMA and GACH; and \u2022 Purporting to act as a director of SMA and GACH by agreeing to stay the RMI proceedings . 27 Please see footnote 7 of 4.3.1.2 of the 6th Receivership Order R eport dated 12 July 2024 ( pages 624-663, page 63 5) 28 Paragraph 4.2.12 of MR25 (pages 664 \u2013 716, page 67 9) 53 Ultimately, Mr Thomas carried out the actions required by the Enforcement Receivers, and the contempt application was compromised with costs ordered in favour of the Enforcement Receivers. 29 July 2022 29 July 2022 Dr Smith contempt of court conviction Dr Smith Dr Smith was convicted of contempt of court in July 2022 in respect of breaches of a restraint order obtained by the SFO, which restricted his access to certain bank accounts.

I have no doubt that the approach taken by those behind Minardi and those behind BKV (to extent that they are different), was co -ordinated, and represented a calculated attempt to delay the hearing and the orders which the Harcus Parker Parties seek. Those individuals should be in no doubt as to the importance which the court attaches to ensuring that its processes are not misused and its orders are complied with, and the full range of the court's powers to serve these ends \u2026 103. As will be apparent from the foregoing, there is a real risk in this case that individuals who are bound by, but unhappy with, the outcome of the Directed Trial have been and are continuing to instigate proceedings and applications in these proceeding s and elsewhere to challenge the outcome of the Directed Trial or by way of a collateral attack on its conclusions. The scale of these activities and the legal costs and court time they are consuming, mean that considerable vigilance will be required on th e court's part to ensure that its judgments are respected and its processes are not abused. 104. If activities of this kind continue, there will need to be careful consideration of a number of matters, including: i) whether there are any individuals who may have breached court orders and undertakings and, if so, whether the court's committal jurisdiction should be engaged; 29 Paragraph 3.4.3 of MR 26 (page 581). The court\u2019s decision is summarised in this link: Convicted fraudster found to be in contempt of court - Serious Fraud Office (sfo.gov.uk) 54 ii) whether officers of the court should be given control of any companies which have changed hands in questionable circumstances, and which are being used in this process; iii) whether further injunctions could or should be granted against individuals where there is a sufficiently arguable case that they are engaged in activities intended to challenge a judgment which is binding upon them; iv) the consequences of undischarged costs orders in the litigation to date; and v) who has been funding these various applications and whether any orders against the funding parties or those controlling them would be appropriate. 31 January 2023 Assignment Application resulting in the Debarring/ Stay Order Thomas Despite Foxton J\u2019s clear direction regarding further collusion and frustration, Messrs Thomas and Taylor sought to bring a further application against Harbour and the other Settlement Parties in early 2023. This application sought an order for the assignment of claims to certain assets identified in the Consequentials Order, currently under the control of office holders. Foxton J issued directions on 31 March 2023 to the effect that Thomas and Taylor were not permitted to bring any further actions against the Settlement Parties without attending a preliminary hearing related to whether their outstanding costs orders should first be satisfied, and that they would be obliged to disclose the involvement of and/or funding provided by Smith and related parties , i.e. the Debarring/Stay Directions . 29 March 2023 Contempt Application made by Mr Sozawiczny against Mr Thomas (Isle of Man Court) Thomas",

The Enforcement Receivers commenced eviction proceedings against Dr Cochrane and Mr Jansen (Dr Smith\u2019s associate who purportedly occupied the property pursuant to an agreement 55 with Dr Cochrane). This application succeeded in the Spanish Court in June 2023 and Dr Cochrane was ordered to pay 108,000 euros to Agata (the \"Spanish Judgment\"), but her eviction was automatically suspended whilst she appealed the Spanish Judgment. In the end, the Spanish Court acceded to the Receivers (as directors of Agata) submission that Dr Cochrane's appeal should be struck out which it was earlier this year. According to the Enforcement Receivers, Mr Thomas asserts that the shares of Agata and Conor (or their proceeds) are (in some way) the property of the \u201cOrb Claimants\u201d held for the Harbour Trust. A summary of the extensive correspondence from Dr Cochrane who threatens litigation in respect of the Spanish Properties30, is as follows: On 11 August 2023, Dr Cochrane wrote to Bernardo Oliver, an architect who is engaged by the Receivers (as directors of Conor) in connection with the sale of Son Monserrat, noting Mr Oliver\u2019s conversation earlier that day with Dr Smith and asserting: a. that the property and Conor are \u201chers\u201d following their lawful transfer to her pursuant to the terms of the Isle of Man Settlement (with 62.5% owned by her and 37.5% owned by Messrs Thomas and Taylor); b. that Will Besga of Mallorca Law SL (\u201cMallorca Law\u201d) and the Enforcement Receivers had conspired to forge a shareholder resolution to remove Gail Cochrane and Ms Stickler as joint directors of Conor and Agata without their consent, with such forgery having been reported to the Mallorcan authorities and Miguel Games of Pinto Rui z & Del Valle having been instructed to bring proceedings against Mr Besga for fraud; c. that Mr Besga and the Enforcement Receivers\u2019 actions in this regard were part of the wider \u201cstrategy of unlawful interference in the outcome of the Directed Trial that Harbour Funding Limited\u2026 is unlawfully engaged in to purloin for itself and others the IOMS proceeds\u201d; and d. that Mr Oliver should provide a written undertaking not to assist any party to purchase Son Monserrat without Dr Cochrane\u2019s express written consent.

Administration application 1 In the context of the Orb Claimants\u2019 failure to honour the terms of the Harbour IA, as addressed in the Directed Trial Judgment, Harbour issued formal demands in Jersey against Orb by letters dated 17 and 26 August 2016 (pages 771-779), and pursuant to these demands, Orb was informed that failing settlement, an application would be made for the appointment of an administrator. 2 Following the formal demand upon Orb referred to above, Harbour applied to the Royal Court of Jersey (the \u201c Royal Court \u201d) for a letter of request to the English High Court seeking an administration order in respect of Orb. The Royal Court's judgment on that application was dated 28 September 2016, Representation of Harbour v Orb [2016] JRC 171 (\u201c the Administration Judgment \u201d) (pages 780-795). 3 In paragraph 40 of the Administration J udgment, the Royal Court noted as follows: - \u201cIn her written responses to the formal demands made by Harbour, Dr Cochrane denies any debt being due by ORB to Harbour, although that denial is not repeated in her affidavit of 7th September, 2016, filed in response to Harbour\u2019s application. Indeed, and perhaps significantly, she says nothing in that affidavit about Harbour\u2019s claim or whether or not it is accepted by ORB. Furthermore, in his skeleton argument, Advocate Nicholls, representing ORB, makes no reference at all to Harbour\u2019s claim and whether or not it is accepted by ORB. His submissions are limited entirely to the lack of any evidence of ORB having assets within England and Wales, a requisite, he says, for any letter of request to be issued. Advocate Nicholls did not appear at the hearing on the 14th September, 2016,",

His submissions are limited entirely to the lack of any evidence of ORB having assets within England and Wales, a requisite, he says, for any letter of request to be issued. Advocate Nicholls did not appear at the hearing on the 14th September, 2016, and therefore the Court was unable to press him on the point, but if ORB had a genuine defence to Harbour\u2019s claim, it would be surprising in the extreme for that defence not to be mentioned, and indeed, given some prominence.\u201d 4 The Royal Court concluded that Harbour was a creditor of Orb with a liquidated claim and that Orb was cash flow insolvent. It nevertheless decided in its discretion not to issue a letter of request on the ground that, given Orb\u2019s incorporation in Jersey an d other matters, a d\u00e9sastre would be the preferable way of proceeding, II. D\u00e9sastre application 60 5 Following the Administration Judgment, Harbour made a formal demand on Dr Cochrane under the terms of her personal guarantee of the obligations of Orb that I describe above. 6 It then applied for declarations of d\u00e9sastre in respect of both Orb and Dr Cochrane. The matter was heard inter partes on 24 November 2016. The Royal Court granted the applications on 24 November 2016 for the reasons set out in a judgment dated 12 January 2017, Harbour v Orb [2017] JRC 007 (\u201c the D\u00e9sastre Judgment \u201d) (pages 796-809). 7 The Royal Court reminded itself (at para graph 13 of the D\u00e9sastre Judgment) that, in order for the Court to declare a d\u00e9sastre , a creditor must show that it has a liquidated claim (i.e. a certain debt which is not the subject of a genuine dispute or an arguable defence) which exceeds the minimum threshold of \u00a33,000 and the creditor must also show that the debtor is insolvent (def ined as meaning \u2018an inability to pay its debts as they fall due\u2019 i.e. on a cash flow basis) but has realisable assets. The Court said that its judgment should be read as a continuation of the Admi nistration judgment. 8 As to whether Harbour was a creditor with a liquidated claim against Orb, at paragraphs 19 - 21 of the D\u00e9sastre Judgment , the Royal Court held: \u201c19. Advocate Drummond, for Harbour, took the Court through a careful analysis, set out in his skeleton argument, of how Harbour\u2019s liquidated claim arose under the Funding Agreement, the Isle of Man Agreement, and the 2014 Agreement, the latter presenti ng an insurmountable hurdle for ORB and Dr Cochrane in that by that Agreement, to which they were a party, they had agreed that the assets recovered by Dr Cochrane under the Isle of Man Agreement (at least \u00a310m) would be treated as proceeds of the English proceedings Harbour had been funding, giving rise to an immediate liability on the part of ORB to repay the sums advanced, namely \u00a35,189,010.48, just short of the aggregate amount Harbour was committed to fund under the funding agreement.\u201d 9 The Court held that Harbour was indisputably owed this sum by Orb and there was no reasonably arguable defence to that claim. It further held that Dr Cochrane had no reasonably arguable defence to the claim against her in this sum pursuant to her guarantee. 10 Having found that Orb had realisable assets, the Royal Court considered the position of Dr Cochrane at paragraph 32 of its",

It further held that Dr Cochrane had no reasonably arguable defence to the claim against her in this sum pursuant to her guarantee. 10 Having found that Orb had realisable assets, the Royal Court considered the position of Dr Cochrane at paragraph 32 of its judgment in the following terms: \u201cIn or around April 2016, Dr Cochrane signed a loan note in favour of Phoenix Group Foundation (\u201cPhoenix\u201d) in the sum of \u00a373.75m in which she represents that she is the ultimate owner of a number of 61 assets set out in Schedule 1 thereto. She also said in her affidavit of 7th September 2016, \u201cI am also privileged to be a very wealthy woman, with holdings in dozens of companies worldwide, including [ORB].\u201d 11 The Royal Court was satisfied that Dr Cochrane and Orb had realisable assets despite the appearance of a strategy to divert assets away from Orb. 12 The Court then considered a submission that Orb had a counterclaim against Harbour in relation to the Harbour IA which it was entitled to set off against any debt owed to Harbour. In this connection the Royal Court said as follows: \u201c44. If this was a genuine claim for \u00a373M, then it was inconceivable to us that no reference had been made to it in the previous proceedings before this Court, in which Dr Cochrane did file an affidavit (which made no reference to it) or at any time at all in the dealings between Orb and Dr Cochrane on the one part and Harbour on the other. It was inconceivable to us that, if the claim was genuine, Orb and Dr Cochrane were unable to give particulars of it sufficient to enable us to assess whether it was re asonably arguable. Furthermore, there was no explanation as to how such a substantial claim came to be filed before the High Court without legal advice a mere two days before the hearing. 45. These arguments had been put forward by Orb and Dr Cochrane at the last moment without any evidence being filed in support on their behalf. In our view, given the background of this matter, we would have expected at least an affidavit from Dr Cochrane to assist us in the exercise of our discretion, an affidavit upon which she would, of course, have been susceptible to cross -examination. She gave us no such assistance.\u201d 13 The Court concluded that to refuse or adjourn the applications for declarations of d\u00e9sastre would be unjust to Harbour and the other creditors. 14 Having regard for various other considerations , the Court held that the requirements for granting a declaration of d\u00e9sastre were met in respect of both Orb and Dr Cochrane and accordingly, on 24 November 2016, the Royal Court declared Orb and Dr Cochrane en d\u00e9sastre (pages 810-817). a. Events following the declaration en d\u00e9sastre 15 On 30 December 2016, Harbour filed a proof of debt in each of Orb and Dr Cochrane's respective d\u00e9sastres (pages 818-847). Those proofs of debt have not yet been adjudicated by the Viscount. 62 16 The Viscount applied to the Royal Court to issue two letters of request to the English Court. Despite what Dr Cochrane had said in her affidavit for the bankruptcy hearing (pages 848-853), the Royal Court noted in its judgment of 16 February 2017 (pages 854- 858) (giving reasons for issuing those letters of request) that (paragraph 9):",

Despite what Dr Cochrane had said in her affidavit for the bankruptcy hearing (pages 848-853), the Royal Court noted in its judgment of 16 February 2017 (pages 854- 858) (giving reasons for issuing those letters of request) that (paragraph 9): \"\u2026 Dr Cochrane has now asserted to the Viscount that she has very few assets. According to her recently completed personal questionnaire and statement of income and expenditure required under Article 18 of the Law, Dr Cochrane has advised that her only as sets consist of six pieces of jewellery, two shares in a company known as Bodega Limited (\u201cBodega\u201d) and an unknown value in a partnership, which the Viscount believes is a share in the medical practice from which she works. Other items of value currently in her possession, which include a substantial art and wine collection, a rib, several high -value motor vehicles and other chattels are said to be owned by Bodega, of which the 99.9% shareholder is said to be Litigation Capital Funding, a New York based en tity believed to be owned by Mr Anthony Smith, the brother of Dr Gerald Smith. Dr Smith is the former husband of Dr Cochrane and has twice been convicted of offences of fraud and served a prison sentence. Dr Smith has advised the Viscount that Orb does n ot have nor has it ever had any assets.\" 17 The judgment further noted that (paragraph 13): \"Following the declarations en d\u00e9sastre, creditors had submitted claims, together with supporting documents, against Dr Cochrane in the sum of \u00a3765,532,125 and against Orb in the sum of \u00a3562,889,913. The Viscount believes there is potentially some degree of duplication in the claims as some creditors have claimed against Dr Cochrane as guarantor of the obligations of Orb. Nevertheless, given the background described in the September judgment and the judgment of Popplewell J and the other matters referred t o above, the Viscount regards it as inconceivable that both Dr Cochrane and Orb have been able to acquire such colossal levels of debt without owning any of the assets listed by Harbour in its application for d\u00e9sastre. The Viscount also notes that Dr Coch rane and Orb are subject to ongoing and vigorously fought legal proceedings in England. Five such sets of proceedings are listed in her affidavit.\" b. Application for a retrospective extension of time to appeal 18 On 31 December 2019, Dr Cochrane applied for an extension of time in which to appeal against the declaration of d\u00e9sastre in her case (pages 859-863). This application first came before Birt JA as a single judge on 14 January 2020, who directed that the matter be brought to the full court (page 86 4). Dr Cochrane\u2019s application was subsequently listed for hearing during the week commencing 27 July 2020. 63 19 On 16 July 2020, Dr Cochrane applied for an adjournment, substantially on the basis that she had a short while earlier dismissed Advocate Blakeley and was planning to instruct a new firm of advocates (pages 865-867). That application for an adjournment was refused by the Court of Appeal in a short judgment dated 20 July 2020 (Cochrane v Harbour Fund II LLP and the Viscount [2020] JCA 140A) (pages 868-872). The new firm was not in fact instructed and accordingly Dr Cochrane appeared as a litigant in person at the hearing. 20 On Friday 24 July 2020 \u2013",

That application for an adjournment was refused by the Court of Appeal in a short judgment dated 20 July 2020 (Cochrane v Harbour Fund II LLP and the Viscount [2020] JCA 140A) (pages 868-872). The new firm was not in fact instructed and accordingly Dr Cochrane appeared as a litigant in person at the hearing. 20 On Friday 24 July 2020 \u2013 the matter being listed for hearing on Tuesday 28 July 2020 \u2013 Dr Cochrane sent to the Court an affidavit dated 23 July 2020 (pages 873-880) together with various exhibits. By a letter dated 27 July 2020 (pages 881-883), she purported to file two further documents. Her application to adduce those documents was rejected (pages 884- 920). 21 The Court of Appeal also noted that (paragraph 100): \"As to creditors, the Viscount states that the current value of claims in Dr Cochrane\u2019s d\u00e9sastre is approximately \u00a3304,293,400, albeit that she has not yet adjudicated upon the claims because she considers it unfair to put potential creditors to the cost o f proving their claims in circumstances where the current English litigation is likely to result in the effective adjudication of many of these claims and where, pending the outcome of those proceedings, the present assets are insufficient to lead to any d istribution.\" 22 The application for an extension of time was dismissed, the Jersey Court of Appeal finding: \"104. \u2026 Given the extremely lengthy delay (nearly three years), and our conclusion that the reasons given for that delay do not provide justification, we would only consider extending the time for appealing if the merits of the proposed appeal were overwhe lming (to use Beloff JA\u2019s expression). That is certainly not the case. As we have described earlier, we conclude that there are minimal prospects of Dr Cochrane being successful in showing that Harbour does not have a liquidated contractual claim in debt , or that she did not have realisable assets at the time of the d\u00e9sastre application. Even in relation to whether Harbour has a proprietary claim to the assets which are the subject of the current English litigation, any case mounted on appeal would be at best arguable; it is certainly not overwhelming. 105. The above factors are sufficient to lead to a rejection of this application. But when one adds in the factor that prejudice would be caused to Harbour and other parties if the application were to be allowed, the case for refusing to extend the time for appealing is unanswerable.\" 64 23 In a separate costs judgment, the Jersey Court of Appeal awarded costs against Dr Cochrane on the indemnity basis (pages 921-924). In respect of her application for an extension of time, it stated: \"7. In our judgment, the Applicant\u2019s conduct in pursuing the Application was unreasonable and takes the case out of the norm. We so conclude for the following reasons: (i) The delay was extreme (nearly 3 years when the time for appealing is 28 days) in circumstances where this Court found that there was no justification for this period of delay. As the Court said at paragraph 104 of its judgment, this alone was s ufficient to lead to dismissal of the Application unless the merits of any appeal were overwhelming. (ii) The period of delay and the inaction by the Applicant has also to be judged against the fact that, to the Applicant\u2019s knowledge, administration of the d\u00e9sastre was continuing throughout this period. (iii) Not only was there extreme delay without justification but this Court",

Extension of Dr Cochrane's bankruptcy 26 On 14 January 2021, the Royal Court granted an application by the Viscount to extend Dr Cochrane's bankruptcy for three years (to 24 November 2023), for the reasons set out in a judgment dated 29 January 2021 (pages 925-930). The Royal Court noted that: \"3. The Viscount has taken control or possession of certain realisable assets of Dr Cochrane valued at approximately \u00a375,000 and believes that Dr Cochrane also owns further realisable assets, including an interest in certain Jersey properties and movable p roperty located therein, and shares in various other 65 companies. However, the ownership of such further assets of Dr Cochrane is currently the subject of proceedings in the High Court of England and Wales (CL -2017-000323) (\u201cthe English Proceedings\u201d). The English proceedings are highly complex, involving 47 parties and numerous personal and proprietary claims. They are summarised in the judgment of the Court in Viscount v Smith [2020] JRC 043. \u2026 7. The claims filed by potential creditors in Dr Cochrane\u2019s d\u00e9sastre total \u00a3305,261,798.37. Due to the ongoing English Proceedings, the Viscount has not yet conducted an inspection of the creditors\u2019 claims, nor has she formally adjudicated or admitted any of them. The Viscount considers that there is no utility in adjudicating any of the creditors\u2019 claims until the present uncertainty is resolved as to whether, and to what extent, there may be any assets available for distribution in the d\u00e9sastre. In her view, it is also unfair to put the creditors to the cost of proving their claims in circumstances where the English Proceedings are likely to result in the effective adjudication of many of their claims, and there are presently no assets available for distribution.\" d. Further application for a (retrospective) application for an extension of time to appeal 27 On 16 August 2023, Dr Cochrane sent an application to the Jersey Court of Appeal seeking an extension of time to appeal against the declarations en d\u00e9sastre of both Dr Cochrane and Orb on the basis that the PACCAR Decision rendered the Harbour IA unlawful and unenforceable (pages 931-933). On 18 August 2023, Harbour confirmed that it intended to oppose this very late, retrospective application for an extension of time (page 934). 28",

On 18 August 2023, Harbour confirmed that it intended to oppose this very late, retrospective application for an extension of time (page 934). 28 As far as we are aware, no directions have been given by the Court of Appeal for the resolution of this application, if indeed it is still being pursued by Dr Cochrane. e. Further application for an extension of the bankruptcy 29 On 3 October 2023, the Viscount issued an application for the further extension of Dr Cochrane's bankruptcy for a further three years (to 24 November 2027) (pages 935-964), resulting in an order of the Jersey Court dated 6 October 2023, convening a substantive hearing ( pages 96 5-969). 30 However, on 27 October 2023, the Viscount and Dr Cochrane agreed to the terms of a consent order that the hearing of that extension application be adjourned until after the determination of any recall application issued by Dr Cochrane (pages 970-971). 66 31 I understand from Harbour\u2019s Jersey lawyer, Advocate Edward Drummond, that irrespective of the outcome of the Viscount's application to extend the bankruptcy of Dr Cochrane, Orb will remain in bankruptcy; the provisions of Articles 39 to 42 of the Bankruptcy ( D\u00e9sastre ) (Jersey) Law 1990 only apply to individuals and do not apply to companies. f. Recall Application 32 On 21 November 2023, Dr Cochrane issued a representation seeking the recall of the declarations en d\u00e9sastre made in respect of her estate and the estate of Orb pursuant to Article 7 of the D\u00e9sastre (Bankruptcy) (Jersey) Law 1990 on the basis that they are both currently balance sheet solvent, with very small (or zero) claims against them, but with assets valued in the tens of millions of pounds. I understand from Harbour\u2019s Jersey lawyers, Bedell Cristin, that a recall petition such as this is adjudicated on the basis of the petitioner\u2019s balance sheet solvency as at the date of the application. Harbour\u2019s position is that Dr Cochrane has misrepresented both the nature of the assets which the Court should take into account (most of which belong to Orb, or were subject to the LCL Settlement I refer to above) as well the value of those assets, which she has grossly inflated. Additionally, Harbour contends that Dr Cochrane has also misrepre sented the liability position insofar as the claims of Harbour and other creditors are concerned. 33 On 1 December 2023, the representation was adjourned to a convening hearing on 6 February 202 4. On that date, for the reasons given in a judgment of the Royal Court dated 23 February 2024 (pages 972-976), the Viscount was convened to the application. Dr Cochrane was given leave to file an Amended Representation (which she did, dated 7 February 2024 (pages 977-991) and she also filed a further affidavit in support (her Third Affidavit sworn on 11 March 2024), which was served on creditors (pages 34 8 \u2013 364). 34 On 18 June 2024, Harbour applied for a stay of the Amended Representation until 28 days after final resolution of Harbour's intended application to the English High Court for a declaration as to the status of the Direct Trial Judgment including as to the i mpact if any of the PACCAR Decision and related ancillary matters (\u201c Harbour\u2019s Recall Stay Application \u201d).

Introduction 1 I am a partner in the firm of Harcus Parker Limited, which has conduct of this matter on behalf of Harbour Fund II , L.P. (\u201cHarbour \u201d). This is my 20thth witness statement in this action (the \u201c Proceedings \u201d) and is made following the conclusion of the trial pursuant to which Mr Justice Foxton rendered his judgment on 18 May 2021 (the \u201c Directed Trial Judgment \u201d)1 and subsequent Consequentials Order dated 11 June 2021 (the \u201cConsequentials Order \u201d) (pages 1-20). 1 The Serious Fraud Office & Anor v Litigation Capital Ltd & Ors [2021] EWHC 1272 (Comm) (18 May 2021) (bailii.org) A1.5/17 2 2 Insofar as the contents of this witness statement are within my own knowledge they are true and , insofar as they are based on things I have read or which have been told to me by others, they are true to the best of my information and belief (the source of such information and belief being identified below). 3 Nothing I say in this witness statement constitutes, or is intended to constitute, a waiver of Harbour\u2019s legal professional privilege or that of the Settlement Parties (as hereinafter defined) . 4 There is now shown to me a bundle of paginated documents marked AKZ -20 containing true cop ies of the documents to which I refer herein. 5 I make this statement in support of Harbour\u2019s application for various relief as set out in draft order provided with the application. In summary, Harbour seeks : 5.1 An order or declaration to the effect that Dr Cochrane is not permitted to seek to challenge the outcome of the Directed Trial (to include the Court\u2019s findings in relation to the ownership of Orb, and its conclusions concerning Harbour\u2019s entitlements based on its Investment Agreement), by reason of her signing the LCL Settlement Agreement as well as a deed dated 23 October 20142 (the \u201c 2014 Harbour Deed \u201d) (pages 21 \u2013 31) (addressed further below); 5.2 An order or declaration to the effect that any attempt now made (whether by Dr Cochrane, Mr Thomas or anyone else) to raise arguments challenging Harbour\u2019s entitlements as found in the Directed Trial, or otherwise seeking to disturb the outcome of the Directed Trial, is an abuse of process or otherwise barred by doctrines of estoppel or similar principles , or is time barred , including (in the case of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas ) estoppe l by the terms of the Harbour Deed ); 5.3 An order or declaration rejecting any argument to the effect that the Harbour IA is unenforceable by reason of the decision of the Supreme Court in R (on the application of PACCAR Inc and others (Appellants) v Competition Appeal Tribunal and others (Respondents) [2023] UKSC 28",

While Mr Thomas has often corresponded with Harbour and the other Settlement Parties on behalf of himself and Mr Taylor , I understand that Mr Taylor may no longer be involved in this matter on a day to day basis. Notably, as I explain further below, Mr Thomas has recently caused a letter before action to be sent to Harbour and has instructed solicitors in his sole name.

Notably, as I explain further below, Mr Thomas has recently caused a letter before action to be sent to Harbour and has instructed solicitors in his sole name.

As such, Harbour has sought a stay of the Jersey Recall Application s pending the determination of this Application5. 13 In response to its stay application , pursuant to a hearing on 25 June 2024 the Royal Court of Jersey directed Harbour to inter alia produce to it a draft of th is Application by 2 August 2024, which it did. A hearing is listed on 12 November 2024 before the Jersey Court to determine Harbour\u2019s stay application , but in the meantime Harbour considers it appropriate to proceed as intended, now that its interactions with Mr Thomas (set out below) appear to have reached their natural conclusion in terms of their usefulness . 14 In addition to (and I believe in connection with) the Jersey Recall Applications, on 11 July 2024 Harbour received a letter before action from Marriot Harrison LLP, instructed by Mr Thomas (the \u201c Thomas Letter Before Action \u201d) (pages 87-106). According to the Thomas Letter Before Action , Mr Thomas now intends to challenge the validity of the Harbour IA in the English Courts, on the basis of the PACCAR Decision. 15 Correspondence has passed between Marriott Harrison and my firm since my firm\u2019s receipt of the Thomas Letter Before Action (pages 107-145), regarding appropriate pre - action steps and the applicability of the 31 March 2023 Order of Foxton J , which required Messrs Thomas and Taylor to provide evidence regarding their source of funding for any 4 Paragraph 7 of Dr Cochrane\u2019s A mended Representation (page 978) 5 Harbour had originally intended to seek a stay in reliance upon the passage through Parliament of the Litigation Funding (Enforceability) Bill, which had been expected to pass into law this year and cure with retrospective effect any PACCAR issues, but did not as a result of the calling of the election on 4 July 2024.

The cooperation between M r Thomas and Dr Cochrane (doubtless both under the direction of and in conjunction with Dr Smith) is apparent both from this reference and the Thomas Letter Before Action , which expressly refers to the Jersey Recall Applications , notwithstanding the fact that he is not ostensibly involved in th e Jersey proceedings .6 17 As indicated above, m y firm has exchanged correspond ence with Marriott Harrison with a view to narrowing the issues between our respective clients . This has included our provi sion to them of a draft of this application as filed with the Jersey Court on 2 August 2024 (including a draft of this witness statement, albeit that it has since been further developed in some respects ). Despite this, it has unfortunately not been possible for the parties to narrow their differences , with the parties\u2019 positions being diametrically opposed . As part of this correspondence , we have repeatedly invited Mr Thomas to set out in detail the consequences of the relief he intends to seek \u2013 in other words \u2013 what the effect would be on the findings made in the Directed Trial Judgment as reflected in the Consequentials Order of an order declaring the Harbour IA to be unenforceable . This is an important point in circumstances where Mr Thomas\u2019 own case at the Directed Trial was advanced on the basis of proprietary rights he asserted as having arise n under the Harbour Trust , and he advanced no alternative proprietary claim. In their letter dated 25 September 2024, Marriott Harrison have said that the effect of their client\u2019s application succeeding would be that Harbour would not be entitled to any part of the assets listed in paragraph 4 of the Consequential s Order and their beneficial owners would be the Orb Claimants. No 6 I note that in an affidavit served by Dr Cochrane on 24 September 2024 in support of the Jersey Recall Applications, Dr Cochrane stated \u201cwhile I am aware of other proceedings being taken in respect of the illegality issue and other matters, I am not acting in concert with any others \u201d. Unfortunately, given my and my client\u2019s extensive experience in these proceedings, I do not accept that either this Court or the Jersey Court can take this suggestion at face value . A1.5/21 6 detailed analysis has been provi ded of how this alleged beneficial interest arises or its interaction with third party proprietary claims advanced at the Directed Trial . 18 Mr Thomas has also sought to argue that the terms of the Debarring /Stay Directions did not reflect the Court\u2019s ruling of 31 March 2023 and has sought to question the way in which the draft order was finalised, despite having been copied on all relevant correspondence with the Court regarding the same , and his comments on the draft having been provided to the Court . In particular, he suggests via Marriott Harrison that the Court\u2019s only intenti on was that he should be required to pay outstanding costs orders in order",

In particular, he suggests via Marriott Harrison that the Court\u2019s only intenti on was that he should be required to pay outstanding costs orders in order to pursue any claim or application against the Settlement Parties. 19 In terms of the position in relation to the outstanding costs orders, Mr Thomas has settled the outstanding costs payments to Harbour due under paragraph 25 of the costs Order of 21 October 2021 , paragraph 3 of the costs order of 8 July 20227and paragraph 8 of the costs order of 24 March 2023. The final costs order was settled by Mr Thomas on 22 October 2024. 20 However, Harbour considers it to be clear that , given the content of Harbour\u2019s application for a debarring order and the Court\u2019s previous experience of Mr Thomas\u2019 conduct in the Part 8 Proceedings and the revelations as to the funding of that matter , the Court i ntended what its order requires, i.e. that Mr Thomas should also provide evidence of both (a) the source of funding for any further claim or application and (b) the involvement of Dr Smith and Mr McNally , or any persons Mr Thomas knows the be associated with them . The Debarring/Stay Directions accordingly accurately reflect the Court\u2019s intention . Harbour\u2019s position, which m y firm has conveyed to Mr Thomas \u2019s solicitors is that the terms of the Debarring/Stay Directions will apply in the event that Mr Thomas files his threatened 7 My understanding, derived from discussions with Stewarts (privilege in relation to which is not waived) is that Messrs Thomas and Taylor were able to make this payment pursuant to a settlement reached with St Paul \u2019s Solicitors (in liquidation) (\u201cSt Paul \u2019s\u201d), a firm instructed by them on various occasions in these proceedings , and previous ly run by Mr Andrew Crossley . My understanding is that on 16 May 2023, Messrs Thomas and Taylor filed a professional negligence claim against St Pauls (the \u201c St Paul\u2019s Claim \u201d), due to the failure by St Paul \u2019s to serve the particulars of claim in separate proceedings against Stewarts which were consequently dismissed by the court . Ultimately, St Paul \u2019s insurer settled the claim . In the interim, as the Court is aware, Stewarts Law filed a third party debt order application (\u201cTPDO Application \u201d) in respect of the settlement monies . On 9 July 2024 , the TPDO Application was dismissed by consent , on terms that provided for (inter alia) significant payments to the funder and ATE providers in respect of Messrs Thomas and Taylor \u2019s negligence claim, a firm of solicitors, as well as payments in respect of Messrs Thomas and Taylor\u2019s outstanding costs obligations. The relevant consent order (\u201c TPDO Consent Order \u201d) is at pages 157 - 159. While I am not aware of the full background to the St Paul \u2019s Claim, I note that St Paul\u2019s appear s to have accepted that it breached the duties it owed to Messrs Thomas and Taylor relatively soon after the negligence action was commenced . Mr Crossley is currently a consultant at another firm, Taylor Rose . I understand that while at Tay lor Rose, Mr Crossley acted for Ms Dawna Stickler in matters related to these proceedings.

A1.5/22 7 application first, makes a cross -application in response to this Application, or otherwise seeks any relief in response to Harbour\u2019s Application . 21 Accordingly, r egardless of whether Mr Thomas has satisfied the costs orders referred to above , it remains Harbour\u2019s position that Mr Thomas must satisfy the remaining provisions of the Debarring/Stay Directions before he is able actively to do anything else. The Debarring/Stay Directions were made in light of Mr Thomas\u2019s repeated efforts to obstruct the Settlement Parties \u2019 efforts to enforce their rights pursuant to the Directed Trial, with support and funding provided by Dr Smith and his associates , and ul timately in those parties\u2019 interests . 22 In light of all of the above , Harbour seeks, by this Application, to achieve a (further) confirmation of finality in terms of the status of the Directed Trial Judgment and related orders and the Harbour IA , such that the Smith Parties are precluded , to the greatest extent possible, from continuing to interfere with the judicial findings of this Court with the result that the realisation process can continue unimpeded . Harbour is aware that to the extent that it is required to go beyond questions of whether Mr Thomas or Dr Cochrane are shut out from re -opening argument, this Application may engage the interests of other parties to the se proceedings . Given the lack of clarity provided by Mar riott Harrison in respect of Mr Thomas\u2019s intended course of action, other parties may argue that, should Mr Thomas succeed, this could potentially re -engage those other parties\u2019 interests in the assets which were the subject of the Directed Trial. 23 As such, if Mr Thomas complies with all the provisions of the Debarring/Stay Directions and this Application is subsequently opposed by Mr Thomas, these type of extremely complex follow -on issues (as well as alternative arguments potentially available to Harbour to sustain its rights) mean that the overriding objective is likely to be best served by case managing issues of principle to be resolved at a first stage, and only if: (a) arguments based on the PACCAR Decision are open to Mr Thomas (and Dr Cochran e); and (b) are successful, to then convene a second stage which can take account of these broader questions . Harbour intends to make more detailed case management proposals in this regard once the initial round of evidence has been exchanged in response to this Application. 24 I should note that Harbour presents this application to this Court, because this Court has substantial familiarity with the underlying history and plainly has an interest in seeing its A1.5/23 8 existing findings and conclusions respected. In addition, the agreements that are the subject of the relevant disputes are governed by English law and contain jurisdiction clauses in favour of the English Courts. It appears, from the Thomas Letter Before Action , that Mr Thomas also envisages bringing his challenge before this Court. However , I note for completeness that the Court\u2019s view may be that although the English Courts are competent and best placed to hear these issues, some of the arguments being co ntemplated",

It appears, from the Thomas Letter Before Action , that Mr Thomas also envisages bringing his challenge before this Court. However , I note for completeness that the Court\u2019s view may be that although the English Courts are competent and best placed to hear these issues, some of the arguments being co ntemplated by Mr Thomas can only be (or are most appropriately) pursued by way of application for permission to appeal the outcome of the Directed Trial to the Court of Appeal , albeit long out of time , rather than to the first instance Court . 25 Indeed, I note in this regard that on 28 September 2023, Mr Thomas wrote to Harbour (on an open basis) enclosing a draft appellant\u2019s notice . Mr Thomas stated in the accompanying letter (marked \u201cUrgent and Immediate \u201d) that his intention was to \u201cappeal against the Directed Trial Judgement of Foxton J. (in particular various terms of the 11 June Consequentials Order, the 14 December 2022 Tru st and Receivership Orders, and the 31 March 2023 Directions (Debarring/Stay application order) \u201d (pages 160-172). Mr Thom as acknowledged that the proposed appeal was out of time, and sought Harbour\u2019s consent to its terms . 26 My firm responded on 29 September 2023 , noting that Mr Thomas\u2019s letter was not accompan ied by grounds of appeal , skeleton argument, any evidence in support o r draft orders (pages 173-174). In fact , it set out no grounds at all for the proposed appeal. Our email stated that we would consider the substance of the application when such materials were provided. Mr Thomas provided no such further materials . 27 I note that Mr Thomas , nine months after his intimated appeal to the Court of Appeal , appears to have decided to take a different approach , instead propos ing to ap ply to th is Court . 28 At this point, as noted above, the precise form of relief sought by Mr Thomas is not entirely clear. The Thomas Letter Before Action concludes that Harbour is \u201c not entitled to any sums from the Proceeds pursuant to the Harbour IA and all of the assets held pursuant to the Harbour Trust are to be released to the funded parties in their appropriate proportions .\u201d and that \u201cAppropriate consequential steps will follow in respect of the assets currently held pursuant to the Harbour Trust, which we would also seek to agree with you without the need for litigation .\u201d. When my firm p ressed for further details of Mr Thomas\u2019s intended relief, Marriott Harrison responded that : A1.5/24 9 \u201c1. It is perfectly clear that if our client succeeds in demonstrating that the Harbour IA (or any specific DBA part of it) is unenforceable: (i) Harbour will not be entitled to any part of the assets listed in paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order (and we note that you do not argue to the contrary); and (ii) their beneficial owners would be the Orb Claimants (in their appropriate proportions) as the claimants in the claim of which these assets are the proceeds. \u201d 29 It is therefore not entirely clear what the appropriate procedural route for such relief sought by Mr Thomas might be , and it is obviously an incomplete analysis, because if Mr Thomas\u2019 rights under the Harbour IA (which were themselves established at the Directed Trial) fall away, he does not articulate how he would nevertheless establish",

Despite this, and w hilst it will be a matter primarily for submissions , I would respectfully suggest that at least some of the reli ef sought by way of this Application can properly be sought from the first instance Court \u2013 by way of example, this Court can rule on the request for relief concerning Dr Cochrane and the LCL Settlement Agreement (which we expand upon at paragraph 84-97 below) , and this Court can also, for example, confirm the present validity of its existing findings so far as it is concerned \u2013 without trespassing on any matters which might fall within the appellate jurisdiction. Further, the time for pursuing any appeal o f the Directed Trial outcome has long since passed, and indeed the PACCAR Decision is no longer recent (having been handed down over a year ago) , such that it is very difficult to see on what basis any prospective appellant could seek permission to appeal out of time from the Court of Appeal in any event . 30 It is also not clear what Mr Taylor\u2019s position is on Mr Thomas\u2019s intended relief, or whether he is even aware of this matter. Harbour will serve a copy of this Application on Mr Taylor and invite him to confirm his position in advance of any hearing. 31 Harbour\u2019s position in respect of the relief sought by Mr Thomas is necessarily reserved, pending compliance with the Debarring/ Stay Directions and clarification of the precise approach taken by him in this litigation, and the basis for that approach. However, Harbour does invite this Court to make such orders as are within its jurisdiction to confirm the final nature of the findings and orders it has made, so as to deal as fully as possible with the recent challenges which have been intimated. B. Executive Summary of the basis of the relief sought by Harbour A1.5/25 10 32 In accordance with its obligations under the Harbour IA, Harbour provided nearly \u00a35.2 million of funding to the Orb Claimants, in order for them to pursue claims against Mr Andrew Ruhan and others in proceedings numbered CL-2012 -000625 (the \u201c Orb Litigation \u201d). I will address further below the mechanism by which Harbour\u2019s entitlement to a return on its investment is calculated . However , it is also relevant to note here that Harbour\u2019s entitlements were secured by: 32.1 a debenture giving Harbour fixed and floating charges over the whole, or substantially the whole, of Orb\u2019s property; and 32.2 a guarantee from Dr Cochrane which was in turn secured by a security interest agreement over the shares in Orb. 33 As this Court knows , the Harbour IA is governed by the law of England and Wales (as are the other transaction documents) . 34 Harbour\u2019s position, in summary, is that there is no basis for disturbing the outcome of t he Directed Trial , to include the Consequentials Order . It is too late for any such attempt to be made now to this Court, and i t would be an abuse of process for the Dr Cochrane,",

It is too late for any such attempt to be made now to this Court, and i t would be an abuse of process for the Dr Cochrane, or Messrs Thomas and Taylor (or any other party) to argue otherwise. Moreover, (a) so far as Dr Cochrane is concerned, she has signed a Deed by which she has expressly agreed not to pursue such points ; and (b) so far as both Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas are concerned, they signed the 2014 Harbour Deed by which they agreed that the recoveries under the IOM Settlement were to be treated as \u201cProceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings\u201d for the purposes of Cl 9.1 of the Harbour IA an d were to be applied in accordance with the terms of that clause . 35 Further, to the extent that Mr Thomas or others seek to rely on the PACCAR Decisio n, and to the extent this Court is prepared to entertain such arguments at all, its effect was not to make new law regarding whether or not litigation funding agreements , such as the Harbour IA , were Damages Based Agreements (a \u201cDBA \u201d or collectively \u201c DBAs \u201d), subject to the terms of the DBA Regulations 2013 (\u201cthe DBA Regulations \u201d). The argument that the Harbour IA is a DBA has been available to the Orb Claimants since the agree ment was first entered into and the possibility that the funding arrangements such as the Harbour IA were in fact subject to the DBA Regulations ha s been publicly debated in legal, academic and political circles since at least 201 4. A1.5/26 11 36 I will set out further below the extensive opportunities that the Orb Claimants have had prior to and during the Directed Trial to seek to run the arguments that Dr Cochrane now advances in the Jersey Recall Application s, and that Mr Thomas has threatened in the Thomas Letter Before Action . Harbour\u2019s position is that the arguments advanced by both Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas (as well as any argument that she or others may advance in opposition to Harbour\u2019s present application), constitute an abuse of process. In the alternative, if that is not the case, they are time barred. 37 Further , and to the extent necessary , Harbour also contends that in any event, the PACCAR Decision, even on its merits, does not render the Harbour IA unenforceable, or that if it does so to some extent, that it is only unenforceable in part . Again, Harbour\u2019s arguments will be further developed in its submissions, but a summary of the key points advanced, and the evidence upon which they are based, is set out below . 38 The remainder of this witness statement is accordingly divided into the following sections : 38.1 The outcome of the Directed Trial as regards Harbour and the Orb Claimants (Section C) ; 38.2 The Smith Parties\u2019 actions since the Directed Trial (Section D) ; 38.3 The Actions of Dr Cochrane specifically (Section E) ; 38.4 The PACCAR decision and its relevance to the Harbour IA (Section F) ; 38.5 The LCL Settlement Agreement and the 2014 Harbour Deed (Section G) ; 38.6 The abusive nature of the Smith Parties\u2019 attempt to seek to invalidate the Harbour",

A1.5/27 12 C. The outcome of the Directed Trial as regards Harbour and the Orb Claimants 39 Given the Court\u2019s familiarity with the Directed Trial, I will not rehearse the extensive background here. By way of summary only, I set out below the salient facts insofar as this Application is concerned. 40 The Directed Trial in these proceedings commenced on 19 January 2021. Shortly thereafter and just before Dr Smith was due to give evidence , on 27 January 2021, the Smith Parties (including Dr Smith and Dr Cochrane, but not including Messrs Thomas and Taylor) entered into a settlement agreement (the \u201c LCL Settlement Agreement \u201d) (pages 175- 337) with Harbour, the Serious Fraud Office (\u201c SFO \u201d), Stewarts Law LLP (\u201c Stewarts \u201d), the liquidators of a group of BVI companies (the \u201c Joint Liquidators \u201d), the Viscount of the Royal Court of Jersey in her capacity as the administrator of the en d\u00e9sastres of Dr Cochrane and Orb (the \u201c Viscount \u201d), and the Receivers of the realisable property of Dr Smith (the \u201c Enforcement Receivers \u201d, together the \u201c Settlement Parties \u201d). The Smith Parties (known in the LCL Settlement Agreement as the LCL Parties) provided undertakings to the Court to assist the Settlement Parties (recorded in an order made on 4 February 2021 (the \u201c LCL Discontinuance Order \u201d)) (pages 338-348) and discontinued their claims , taking no further part in the Directed Trial. 41 On 16 May 2021, the Directed Trial Judgment was handed down. All of the claims advanced by Harbour and the other Settlement Parties succeeded in all material respects. 42 In respect of Orb and Dr Cochrane, the Judge made the following findings: 42.1 The shares of Orb were found to be the realisable property of Dr Smith, further to a Confiscation Order obtained by the SFO on 13 November 2007 in the sum of \u00a340,856,9118 (the \u201c Confiscation Order \u201d). 42.2 More generally, the judge found that Dr Cochrane held the shares in the Non - Arena Companies (including Orb), for Dr Smith, as his nominee. 42.3 Separately, the Judge found that 50% of Bodega (the company which owns Steephill, the property in Jersey in which Dr Cochrane resides) was held by its legal owner (Dr Cochrane) on the terms of the Harbour Trust in respect of which the Judge subsequently, on 14 December 2022, appointed receivers on the application 8 I understand that the current balance of the Confiscation Order, including interest, is around \u00a382 million.

With the exception of the shares in Bodega, Dr Gerald Martin Smith holds 100% of the equitable interest in the shares of each of the Non Arena Companies (as set out in Schedule 2 to this order). 17.

All of the shares in Litigation Capital Limited are held in the name of Conduit Asset Management Limited for Anthony Smith, who in turn holds them as a nominee for Dr Gerald Martin Smith, who thereby holds a 100% equitable interest in the said shares. 19. Save as otherwise provided for by the declarations in this order any and all residuary equitable interests in the Relevant Property and IUAs are held either by the Viscount of the Royal Court of Jersey, in her capacity as the administrator of the en d\u00e9 sastre (bankruptcy) proceedings of Dr Cochrane, or by Dr Gerald Martin Smith.\u201d 46 The most immediately relevant aspect of the Directed Trial findings in respect of the SFO is that Orb (a Non -Arena Company) is the realisable property of Dr Smith and therefore subject to the SFO\u2019s Confiscation Order , per paragraph 16 of the Consequentials Order. While I understand that Dr Cochrane remains the nominal legal shareholder of Orb, the Consequentials Order is unequivocal : she has no right to Orb or its assets. A1.5/31 16 47 Dr Cochrane sought, by an application of 10 January 2024 of which I provide further details below, to remove Orb from the list of Non -Arena companies in the Consequentials Order, and her application was dismissed and certified as being \u201c totally without merit \u201d. As such, Dr Cochrane has identified no basis for disturbing paragraph 16 of the Consequentials Order. 48 It is particularly notable that Dr Cochrane\u2019s Jersey Recall Applications , and in particular the exercise she proposes in order to assess her personal financial position are premised in large part on an account of Orb\u2019s assets , which she assert ed (wrongly) were to be treated as her own .

In her third affidavit of 11 March 2024 , Dr Cochrane also initially claimed to \u201cown 100% of the shares of Orb\u201d (pages 349 \u2013 365), and omitted to inform the Jersey Court of the full effect of the Directed Trial\u2019s finding that Orb\u2019s shares constituted the realisable property of Dr Smith. At the hearing of 26 June 2024 , the Jersey Court indicated its disapproval of Dr Cochrane\u2019s failure to e xplain the findings as to Orb in the Directed Trial Judgment given that she was subject t o a duty of full and frank disclosure when seeking permission to serve the Recall Application out of the jurisdiction , and required Dr Cochrane to explain her omission . As I note further below, Dr Cochrane has since amended her position in relation to the shares of Orb. D. The Smith Parties\u2019 actions since the Directed Trial 49 As indicated above, the Smith Parties have by various means sought to frustrate the outcome of the Directed Trial Judgment and related orders. Given the many separate instances, these , with the exception of Dr Cochrane\u2019s activities in Jersey given the recen t nature of the Jersey Recall Applications, are only summarised in this witness statement. Appendix 1 to this statement contains a more detailed record of the activities in question9. 50 The disruptive actions , unlawful conduct and court proceedings issued or necessitated include: 50.1 Resistance on the part of Dr Cochrane of the steps taken by the Enforcement Receivers regarding the control of Casa Coloniches (a Non -Arena Company) ; 9 Appendix 1 cross -refers to official reports provided by the Enforcement Receivers , in accordance with the terms of the Variation Order dated 7 December 2017 (which I refer to by the prefix \u201cMR \u201d) and the Receivership Order date d 14 De cember 2022 . They are restricted to a circulation list which includes Harbour, the Viscount and Mr Thomas, but are otherwise confidential. The Enforcement Receivers have confirmed that these documents may , in redacted form, be referred to for the purp oses of this application. Redactions have been applied in respect of commercially sensitive information.

This led to the Debarring/Stay Directions (pages 382-384); 50.10 Proceedings involving Mr Sodzawiczny before the Isle of Man courts, which culminated in Mr Thomas and a Mr Miah (who had been involved in the activities referred to at paragraph 50.8 above ) being found to be in contempt of court as a result of their failure to remove a company director whose actions were in breach of an injunction protecting Mr Sodzawiczny\u2019s interests in property in Spain ; A1.5/33 18 50.11 Prolonged o bstruction of the Enforcement Receivers by Dr Cochrane and other Dr Smith associates10 in respect of C\u2019an Agata and Son Montserrat (the \u201cSpanish Properties \u201d); 50.12 Dr Smith and Dr Cochrane purporting to commence an LCIA Arbitration resulting in Mr Sodzawiczny needing to seek and obtaining an anti -arbitration injunction; 50.13 The Slip Rule Application; 50.14 Mr Thomas\u2019s threatened claim against Harbour in respect of his purported rights under the Harbour IA to require H arbour to indemn ify him for his own outstanding costs obligations (pages 3 88 \u2013 389)11; 50.15 Dr Smith being convicted of fraud on 29 July 2024 in relation to fraudulently obtaining COVID -19 Bounce Back Loans , and subsequently on 20 September 2024 sentenced to 18 months imprisonment12.

I would respectfully suggest that t he challenges which they have mounted in re liance upon the PACCAR Decision should be considered in that context ; namely, that arguments over enforceability of the Harbour IA are merely the latest means by which these parties seek to undermine decisions of this court with which Dr Smith and others do not agree.

A1.5/35 20 54 In a letter dated 11 April 2023 (pages 439-448) Dr Cochrane alleged breaches by Harbour of the Harbour IA, a conspiracy against the Orb Claimants by Harbour and the Settlement Parties, and that (directly contrary to the findings of the Directed Tr ial) she was personal ly entitle d to the assets of Orb. Specifically, her letter stated : \u201cby failing to honour [Harbour\u2019s] agreements terms [they] prevented us from obtaining additional litigation funding\u2026this was [Harbour\u2019s] first repudiatory breach\u201d. \u201cthe [2019 Settlement Agreement] sets outs out the mechanics of [Harbour\u2019s] conspiracy against the Orb Claimants\u201d \u201cThe Orb claimants won [the Directed Trial]. The so called settling parties have not. And yet you have over the last 2 years, as \u201cLead\u201d conspired to prevent the Harbour Trust from coming into functional being in fundamental breach of your own Harbour IA te rms\u201d. \u201cThe monies recovered by the Orb Claimants belong to them pursuant to the terms of the Harbour IA trust arrangements. I, as the 100% owner of Orb, want it to receive what it is entitled to.\u201d 55 My firm responded to these accusations on 11 May 2023 (pages 452-454): 55.1 confirming that Harbour emphatically den ied any impropriety or breach of any obligations , or that it has caused Dr Cochrane any loss; 55.2 Reiterating the position on Orb\u2019s ownership, referring to the Directed Trial judgment whereby it was held that, notwithstanding Dr Cochrane being the registered shareholder, the shares held in Orb were held as nominee for Dr Smith and therefore, recoverable by the SFO ; and 55.3 Indicating to Dr Cochrane that her correspondence appeared to be a \u201c coordinated attempt by [her], Mr Thomas and Dr Smith to further frustrate the outcome of the Directed Trial\u201d . 56 It is clear to me that from at least April 2023, Dr Cochrane\u2019s intention was to gain control of the assets of the Harbour Trust, as well as the assets of Orb. This is the position she maintains now , albeit premised on the alleged unenforceability of the Harbour IA, rather than the previous allegations of (presumably repudiatory) breache s of the Harbour IA by A1.5/36 21 Harbour. However, as the Court will note, this chain of communications was commenced by Dr Cochrane before the PACCAR Decision was handed down . 57 Following the PACCAR Decision , Dr Cochrane re -commenced correspondence with Harbour, now seeking its agreement to an application to set aside or annul her d\u00e9sastre , and that of Orb, on the ground that they were obtained by Harbour in circumstances where the Harbour IA was an unlawful and/or unenforceable agreement. 58 On numerous occasions during this period, Harbour set out its position to Dr Cochrane in correspondence. By way of example, in a letter of 10 August 2023 (pages 452-453), my firm responded to Dr Cochrane as follows: \u201c5. As to paragraph 7 of your letter, Harbour\u2019s position is as follows: a) The orders made in and in relation to the SFO Proceedings numbered CL -2017- 000323 including the Directed Trial Consequentials Order and the 14 December 2022 Trust and Receivership Order remain valid, binding and enforceable and Harbour will naturally a bide by their terms. b) No party sought to challenge the enforceability of the Investment Agreement at the Directed Trial despite having had the opportunity to do so. Any attempt to do so now would constitute an abuse of the court\u2019s process. c) Your suggestion that the Investment Agreement \u201cwas unlawful from its signature and is unenforceable\u201d is legally misconceived,",

Any attempt to do so now would constitute an abuse of the court\u2019s process. c) Your suggestion that the Investment Agreement \u201cwas unlawful from its signature and is unenforceable\u201d is legally misconceived, for various reasons, and is in any case irrelevant given that the underlying issues have already been adjudicated.\u201d 59 On 14 August 2023, Dr Cochrane accused both Harbour and the Viscount of an \u201c unlawful means conspiracy to manipulate [her] circumstances to keep [her] in a state of \u201cdesastre\u201d for [their] improper economic purposes. Manipulation that has been ongoing for almost 7 years \u201d (pages 457-458). The letter, as well as a letter dated 16 August 2023 (pages 459-460), sought to obtain their consent to support Dr Cochrane\u2019s application to \u201cset aside/ annul\u201d the d\u00e9sastre orders. 60 On 21 August 2023, Dr Cochrane again accused Harbour of \u201c an evolving conspiracy that repetitively breached the Harbour IA terms \u201d, alleging that Harbour \u201c victimised \u201d the funded parties (pages 461- 463). 61 In a letter dated 25 August 2023, Dr Cochrane assert ed that she intended to seek \u201c\u2026compensatory and or restitutionary damages. Be that through the Courts of Jersey, the Privy Counsel A1.5/37 22 [sic], the English High Court or the courts of the Cayman Islands or the USA \u201d. In the same letter, Dr Cochrane again allege d that Harbour has \u201c deliberately and with malice and forethought [sic], unlawfully damaged and impacted my family\u2019s and my life and the Orb Claimants rights \u201d (pages 464- 465). 62 On 23 October 2023, Dr Cochrane made another request for Harbour to agree to a consent order in support of her set aside application (pages 466-467). On the same day, our firm responded, repeating Harbour\u2019s position that her assertion as to the supposed \u201cmistake\u201d in the drafting of the Consequentials Order was \u201cbaseless and inaccurate\u201d (pages 468-469). 63 Materially similar allegations were made by Dr Cochrane on the next day, 24 October 2023, in relation to the composition of the Non -Arena companies and Orb\u2019s ownership in direct conflict with the Directed Trial Judgment and Consequentials Order, as well as against Harbour of \u201c serial (and most probably repudiatory breaches) of its own agreements terms \u201d (pages 470- 474). The Slip Rule Application 64 Notwithstanding this firm having set out Harbour\u2019s position on the matter in correspondence , Dr Cochrane ultimately filed an application on 10 January 2024 to amend the Consequentials Order purportedly under the \u2018Slip Rule\u2019 to remove Orb from the list of Non -Arena Companies, on the basis that it had been included by mistake when the order was drafted (the \u201c Slip Rule Application \u201d) (pages 475-487). 65 On 15 January 2024, my firm filed written submissions in response to the Slip Rule Application (pages 488-494), arguing that the application should be dismissed for the following reasons: 65.1 Dr Cochrane did not have standing to bring this application, on the basis that she remains subject to d\u00e9sastre in Jersey and is represented by the Viscount; 65.2 The application was without merit ; and 65.3 The application was made by and/or with the support of Dr Smith and his associates, with the aim of frustrating court judgments and orders.

All of the previous correspondence purportedly sent by Dr Cochrane bear s the distinctive hallmarks of Dr Smith \u2019s letter -writing style . Further, Harbour \u2019s submissions referred to a letter of 2 January 2024 which purports to have been sent by Dr A1.5/38 23 Cochrane and Mr Thomas to Susan Dunn of Harbour, Mr Jackson of Quantuma (one of the Joint Liquidators) as well as the managing partner of Stewarts Law, Mr Dench, containing allegations of conspiracy by Harbour, the Joint Liquidators and Stewarts against the Orb Claimants. The metadata on this letter showed that it was drafted by Dr Smith (who is listed as the \u2018author\u2019), rather than by Dr Cochrane. 66 On 17 January 2024, Dr Cochrane responded to Harbour\u2019s submissions by asserting that: \u201c\u2026the Directed Trial did not determine that my ownership of Orb arl was as a nominee for Dr Gerald Smith as paragraph 1 of the Consequentials Order makes clear \u201d (paragraph 4) (pages 495-500). 67 On the same day, Dr Cochrane wrote to the Viscount\u2019s Jersey lawyers, Ogier (pages 501- 503). In particular, she wrote that : \u201cI understand from that advice that at the convening hearing the Royal Court will be asked to make substantive decisions as to whether certain claimants who have filed claims in my d\u00e9sastre process and the d\u00e9sastre process of Orb a.r.l (Orb) are properly t o be treated as creditors. It would be unreasonable to ask the Royal Court to undertake the process of reviewing all the claims with respect to Orb if it is a Non -Arena company.\u201d 68 Shortly thereafter, on 22 January 2024 , Foxton J dismissed the Slip Rule Application on the papers, on the basis that D r Cochrane had no standing , and certified the application itself as being \u201c totally without merit\u201d (\u201cthe Slip Rule Application Ruling \u201d) (pages 504- 505). In his ruling, Foxton J highlighted (inter alia) the following relevant passages of the Directed Trial Judgment (with emphasis added ): \u201c606. Subject to (a) my finding as to the Retained 50% in Bodega (at [503(iv)] above) and (b) any issues which arise as to the effect of the Ozturk No 2 Trust which do not form part of the Directed Trial, I am satisfied that Dr Cochrane held the shares in the Non -Arena Companies as Dr Smith\u2019s nominee. I would note that neither Dr Cochrane nor Dr Smith now seek to challenge this finding, and I am satisfied that it is established on the evidence. In summary: i) Dr Smith has a track record of seeking to disguise his interest in assets behind Dr Cochrane. The investigations brought by the SFO in connection with the Izodia Theft identified a ski chalet held through a corporate vehicle of which Dr Cochrane was a di rector and the transfer of his luxury car collection into Dr Cochrane\u2019s name shortly after the Izodia Theft came to light. A1.5/39 24 ii) Although notionally assetless, Dr Smith has been able to live \u201chigh on the hog\u201d (in his own phrase) off assets notionally owned by Dr Cochrane, spending those assets in accordance with Dr Smith\u2019s idiosyncratic tastes (including a commissioned water clo ck and artwork chosen by Dr Smith) or for his personal benefit (for example on private jet travel,",

While I accept that much of the money spent by Dr Smith belonged to others, the freedom with which he diss ipated assets notionally in Dr Cochrane\u2019s ownership is relevant when considering whether such interest as Dr Cochrane had in those assets was held in her own right, or as Dr Smith\u2019s nominee. iii) Dr Cochrane has on a number of occasions proclaimed that she is a \u201cbusy GP with two young daughters and no real business experience\u201d, with minimal knowledge of Dr Smith\u2019s business activities. Dr Smith has himself accepted that Dr Cochrane lacked \u201cany independent experience of the world of business, the world of property deals \u201d. The vast network of companies which she apparently owns, and the complex web of dealings in which those companies have engaged, strongly support the suggestion that her involvem ent is nothing more than as a cipher, and that Dr Smith \u2013 with his extensive track -record of complex, contrived and dishonest business dealings \u2013 is \u201ccalling the shots\u201d . iv) Dr Cochrane has no obvious sources of independent wealth from which she might have acquired these assets independently of Dr Smith. In 2005, according to her own evidence, she was close to destitution, and in 2014 and 2016, she gave accounts of her assets and wealth which identified no substantial assets beyond those transferred under the IOM Settlement . v) The confiscation order made against Dr Smith gave him every incentive to hide his ownership of assets behind a nominee owner who he could trust to follow his directions. It is clear that Dr Smith has acted at all times since the Confiscation Order was made with a view to making it appear as if he has no assets \u2013 for example his Deed of Separation with Dr Cochrane of 11 March 2014 sought to give Dr Smith all the benefits o f certain properties, while transferring no property for the SFO to attach. 69 The Slip Rule Application Ruling constituted an unambiguous rejection of Dr Cochrane\u2019s contention that she was entitled to treat Orb\u2019s assets as her own on the basis that Orb was not a Non -Arena Company. By extension, her contention that Orb\u2019s assets should be A1.5/40 25 treated as her own for the purposes of determining her balance sheet solvency is unsustainable . Notwithstanding this definitive ruling (and the Directed Trial Judgment and the LCL Settlement Agreement ), this assertion as to Dr Cochrane\u2019s ownership of Orb was advanced in Dr Cochrane\u2019s Third Affidavit of 11 March 2024 in support of her Amended Representation (pages 348-364) (as described in more detail at paragraph 33 of Appendix 2 below), in which at paragraph 28 she states that she \u201c holds 100% of the shares of Orb a.r.l \u201d (omitting any mention of the findings of the Directed Trial in relation to Orb) and then, at paragraph 35, claims that Orb\u2019s assets are \u201c relevant in calculating [her] balance sheet solvency \u201d.

I respectfully suggest that, in so doing, she was seeking actively to mislead the Jersey Court. 70 Perhaps in response to the concerns raised by the Jersey Court over her characterisation of the ownership of Orb , Dr Cochrane \u2019s position in Jersey has more recently developed, such that she now concedes that \u201cit is correct that paragra ph 16 of the Order of Foxton J dated 11 June 2021 \u2026 states that Dr Smith holds 100 % of the equitable interest of the shares in the Non -Arena Companies (listed in Schedule 2 of that Order )\u201d. However, in order to maintain her position in respect of Orb\u2019s recall application, Dr Co chrane now argues that \u201cthe Directed Trial did not determine the ownership of the assets owned by the Non -Arena Companies \u201d, which, for the first time, she now asserts \u201c are held on resulting trust of [sic] the benefit of the Orb Claimants \u201d. (page 1061 ) Dr Cochrane has not yet elucidated how her arguments regarding Orb are to her own benefit, given that she holds no interest in Orb , and it is not a fully accurate statement in any event, given that the IUAs (which the Directed Trial did determine ownership of ) were owned by various Non -Arena Companies . 71 A summary of the background to Dr Cochrane\u2019s Jersey Recall Applications is set out in Appendix 2 to this statement , which has been prepared with the assistance of Harbour\u2019s Jersey lawyers . F. The PACCAR Decision and its relevance to the Harbour IA 72 This Court will be aware of the PACCAR Decision. By way of very brief summary, the Supreme Court found that certain litigation funding agreements fell within the definition of DBAs , for the purposes of the section 58AA of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (\u201cCLSA 1990 \u201d). 73 However, in order to establish if the Harbour IA is in fact a DBA, a thorough analysis is required of the relevant regulatory framework, and of the Harbour IA itself. A1.5/41 26 74 For an agreement to qualify as a damages based agreement, such that it is subject to the DBA Regulations, it must satisfy three requirements (see Section 58AA (3) CLSA 1990 ): 74.1 First, it must be an agreement between a person providing \u201c advocacy services, litigation services or claims management services \u201d and the recipient of those services; 74.2 Second, it must provide for the recipient \u201c to make a payment to the service provider if the recipient obtains a specified financial benefit in connection with the matter in relation to which the services are provided \u201d; and 74.3 Third, the amount of that payment must be \u201c determined by reference to the amount of the financial benefit obtained by the recipient \u201d. 75 My understanding is that the PACCAR Decision revolved principally around the first of these grounds, and established that litigation funders were providers of \u201c claims management services \u201d. Harbour cannot, and does not, dispute this finding or the reasoned conclusions of the Supreme Court before this Court (although it reserves its position in the event that any other point ultimately had to be determined by the Supreme Court) .15 As such, for these purposes Harbour proceeds on the",

Harbour cannot, and does not, dispute this finding or the reasoned conclusions of the Supreme Court before this Court (although it reserves its position in the event that any other point ultimately had to be determined by the Supreme Court) .15 As such, for these purposes Harbour proceeds on the basis that it provides claims management services, and thus the Harbour IA satisfies the first requirement of a DBA according to the CLSA 1990. 76 In relation to the second requirement, I understand this to apply to any contingent funding, non-recourse agreement whereby the funder will only receive a return if the funded parties succeed and proceeds are received. This is the basis upon which Harbour and other funders structure their funding agreements, and Harbour will not seek to contend otherwise in respect of the Harbour IA. 77 For the purposes of this statement, I will focus on the third CLSA requirement, namely that a DBA contains provision for a funder\u2019s return which are \u201c determined by reference to the amount of the financial benefit obtained by the recipient \u201d. I understand this to mean, in simple terms, where a funding agreement provides for a funder\u2019s return to be calculat ed by 15 I note, however, that considerable efforts have been made by the legislature to introduce legislation in order to correct this position, which appears not to have been intended by the drafters of the amendment to the CLSA 1990. Unfortunately given the timing of the General Election , it has not yet been possible for this legislation to be passed. While Harbour, alongside others in the funding industry, remain hopeful that such legislation will be introduced, in the intervening period the PACCAR Decision has allowed parties such as Dr Cochrane and others to seek to undermine funding agreements such as the Harbour IA notwithstanding the fact that the funded parties have taken the benefit of the funding . A1.5/42 27 reference to a percentage of the proceeds of the funded action, and it also satisfies the first two criteria set out above, it will meet the definition of a DBA. 78 The Harbour IA , at Schedule 2, contains a mechanism for calculating Harbour\u2019s return in the event that the Orb Claimants succeeded in the funded proceedings, which I extract below (\u201cSchedule 2 \u201d): 79 This tiered structure was agreed in order to account for both the time period of the receipt of any Proceeds, as well as the amount of such proceeds. As I understand it, this again conforms with standard industry practice. The first two rows were agreed to cover the eventuality of an early settlemen t of the funded proceedings, in order to allow for greater A1.5/43 28 recovery by the Orb Claimants in the event that the proceedings were brief. Harbour\u2019s return is therefore based on recovery both on a percentage basis, and by reference to a multiple of its investment. 80 If a funding agreement meets the criteria set out in the CLSA 1990 it is a DBA which must also comply with the requirements of the DBA Regulations , in particular Section 3 of those regulations: 3. The requirements prescribed for the purposes of section 58AA(4)(c) of the Act are that the terms and conditions of a damages -based agreement must specify \u2014 (a) the claim or proceedings or parts of them to which the agreement relates; (b) the circumstances in which the representative\u2019s payment, expenses and",

The requirements prescribed for the purposes of section 58AA(4)(c) of the Act are that the terms and conditions of a damages -based agreement must specify \u2014 (a) the claim or proceedings or parts of them to which the agreement relates; (b) the circumstances in which the representative\u2019s payment, expenses and costs, or part of them, are payable; and (c) the reason for setting the amount of the payment at the level agreed, which, in an employment matter, shall include having regard to, where appropriate, whether the claim or proceedings is one of several similar claims or proceedings. 81 It is my understanding that it has never been standard practice in the funding industry, as reflected in the approach taken in the Harbour IA , to include reasons in funding agreements for the funder\u2019s return. No such reasons are set out in the Harbour IA. As such, again, Harbour does not conten d that the Harbour IA meets the requirements of the DBA Regulations. I note that the Minister of State responsible for piloting the DBA Regulations through Parliament, Lord McNally, followed up questions on the draft regulations in Grand Committee with a formal written response to Lord Beecham on 5 March 20 13 (pages 50 6-510), shortly before they were promulgated on 1 April 2013 . He stated that: \u201c The DBA Re gulations update the 2010 regulations, and take account of recommendations made by the Civil Justice Council (CJC) .\u201d 82 The CJC\u2019s position had been set out in a letter dated 24 October 2012 to the Ministry of Justice (pages 5 11-514) in the context of the statutory consultation required under LASPO , which was also extended to non -statutory stakeholders . Among the CJC\u2019s recommendations had been a proposed amendment to the information required to be given to a client entering a DBA , which referred to the availability of other methods of financing the claim or financing the proceedings. The CJC suggested the addition of third A1.5/44 29 party litigation funding into the list, reflecting its view that this was a type of alternative to a DBA, not a DBA itself , and that the Government was not consulting on the basis that litigation funding agreements would be subject to the regulations . 83 The CJC\u2019s suggestion was not taken up. However, in Lord McNally\u2019s letter, u nder the heading \u201cThird party litigation funding\u201d he expressly stated on behalf of the Government : The matter was debated at some length during the passage of the LASPO Act through Parliament. Some colleagues were concerned about the future growth of third party litigation funding arrangements and, in particular, a move into personal injury claims. While there was a call for the introduction of statutory regulation, the Government does not believe this is the right course of action at this stage: rather this is an issue that we are keeping under review and we will not hesitate to act should we need to do so in the future.

To comply, as soon as reasonably practicable, with reasonable requests made of them by the ERs, JLs and/or Viscount (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by meeting with the ERs, JLs and/or Viscount, providing them with information or documentation, and executing such documents as they may require) in connection with safeguarding and/or realising the Paragraph 3 Property. 9.4. To take the specific steps or refrain from taking the specific steps (as the case may be) as set out in Schedule 3, save that a reference to one or more of the LCL Parties individually in relation to a specific obligation contained therein shall not b e considered to be an obligation owed by the remaining LCL Parties.\u201d 86 It has be come apparent to Harbour, and to me, that the Smith Parties, in particular Dr Smith and Dr Cochrane, have never intended to honour the terms of the LCL Settlement Agreement. Indeed, shortly after the conclusion of the Directed Trial, on 9 August 2021, my firm received a letter from Mr Spragg of Keystone Law, solicitors to Litigation Capital Limited (\u201c LCL \u201d)16, arguing that Harbour did not succeed at the Directed Trial and therefore the LCL Settlement Agreement had \u201c no continuing force or effect \u201d (page 515). We responded on 12 August 2021, refuting this assertion. Mr Spragg responded on 16 August 2021, noting (without explanation) that: \u2022 \u201cThe judgement awarded all the assets to the Orb Claimants, \u2022 The LCL parties\u2019 \u2013 SPs parties\u2019 agreement was conditional and between themselves. It did not include the Orb Claimants, \u2022 LCL did not release the Orb Claimants \u201d (pages 516-517). 87 The background to LCL \u2019s involvement in these proceedings is well known to the Court and I will not rehearse it in detail here. In short, LCL is a vehicle of the Smith Parties, and at various times Dr Cochrane, Mr Taylor and Mr Anthony Smith (Dr Smith\u2019s brother) 16 On 24 November 2021 , we received an email from an \u2018Admin LCL\u2019 proton mail account attaching a document headed \u2018Notice of Change\u2019 which stated that Keystone Law no longer acted for LCL and that LCL would be acting in person. A1.5/47 32 have been its directors. I n the circumstances, therefore , Mr Spragg\u2019s correspondence was sent in the interests (and most likely at the direction) of Dr Smith, Dr Cochrane and Messrs Thomas and Taylor , who , as early as two months after the Consequentials Order was made, were already putting into motion plans to prevent the Settlement Parties from enforcing the rights they had established at the Directed Trial. While no party has formally sought to challenge the validity of the LCL Settlement Agreement, sever al of the Smith Parties have acted in clear breach of its terms. I summarise several such acts below, and refer to further details which are set out in Appendix 1: 87.1 Mr Thomas appears to have colluded with LCL in relation to its efforts in the Republic of the Marshall Islands to frustrate the efforts of the",

I summarise several such acts below, and refer to further details which are set out in Appendix 1: 87.1 Mr Thomas appears to have colluded with LCL in relation to its efforts in the Republic of the Marshall Islands to frustrate the efforts of the Enforcement Receivers, in contravention of LCLs\u2019 obligations under the LCL Settlement Agreement and the LCL Disco ntinuance Order. In doing so, Mr Thomas incited a clear breach of the LCL Discontinuance Order by LCL. The Enforcement Receivers commenced contempt proceedings against Mr Thomas, which were ultimately discontinued when Mr Thomas corrected the position. 87.2 Dr Smith directly committed numerous breaches of the LCL Settlement Agreement by impeding the Enforcement Receivers\u2019 attempts to manage and realise assets to which Harbour is entitled pursuant to the Directed Trial Judgment, namely the Hamilton House properties; 87.3 Dr Cochrane breached her obligations under the LCL Settlement Agreement by impeding the efforts of the Enforcement Receivers to manage and realise properties in Spain, which ultimately led to the ruling of 18 April 2024 to which I refer below. 88 In the case of Dr Cochrane, as I outline above, the release of claims under the LCL Settlement is directly relevant to the Jersey Recall Applications . This is because Dr Cochrane has asserted proprietary rights over Orb (which also disregards the outcome of the Directed Trial) , as well as listing within her estate various properties to which she has waived any rights by way of the LCL Settlement Agreement . 89 Although this will be a matter for development in submissions, Harbour\u2019s position is that the release and waiver given by Dr Cochrane and the other Smith Parties under the LCL Settlement Agreement is broad and (as set out above) extends to, among other things: \u201call A1.5/48 33 and any actions, claims, rights, demands and set -offs, whether capable of being litigated or enforced in this jurisdiction or any other, whether presently known or unknown to the Parties or to the law, and whether arising in law or equity, under statute or otherwise, that they have, had, may have or hereafter can or shall or may subsequently acquire \u2026\u201d 90 The LCL Settlement Agreement also contains no -contest clauses. I would respectfully suggest that , taken as a whole, the LCL Settlement Agreement precludes Dr Cochrane from seeking to ventilate the arguments that she does in relation to the effect of PACCAR on the Directed Trial Judgment and the Harbour IA in the Jersey Proceedings \u2013 she has agreed to a full settlement and is no longer entitled to seek to go behind Harbour\u2019s entitlements. 91 As I explain above, while LCL (and thus, undoubtedly, Dr Smith) questioned the validity and enforceability of the LCL Settlement Agreement, Dr Cochrane has not formally advanced this position, as far as Harbour is aware . Instead, in her Jersey Recall Applications she has sought simply to ignore it. As the Court is aware, however, the issue of the validity of the LCL Settlement Agreement (and more specifically the LCL Discontinuance Order) came before the Court earlier this year and has been determined . 92 While Harbour was not directly involved, I am aware of a ruling in these proceedings given on 18 April 2024 (the \u201c LCL Undertakings Ruling \u201d) (pages 518-519). I understand the context of this ruling is complex, and relates to efforts made by the Enforcement Receivers to carry",

I understand the context of this ruling is complex, and relates to efforts made by the Enforcement Receivers to carry out their duties to realise certain assets in Spain, which Dr Cochrane has incorrectly asserted belong to the Orb Claimants. As set out above and further explained in Appendix 1, Dr Cochrane has impeded the efforts of the Enforcement Rec eivers, in direct contravention of the undertakings she gave in the LCL Discontinuance Order, which reflect Dr Cochrane\u2019s obligations pursuant to the LCL Settlement Agreement, and which are accompanied by a penal notice. 93 My understanding is that the LCL Undertakings Ruling\u2019s effect was to confirm the binding nature of the undertakings contained within the LCL Discontinuance Order. As such, I respectfully suggest that Dr Cochrane\u2019s obligations under the LCL Settlement Agree ment remain valid and binding and that the Court has already finally determined this question . 94 I also note that the LCL Undertakings Ruling contained the following finding at paragraph 12: A1.5/49 34 \u201cDr Cochrane has no standing to act in any form of trustee capacity on behalf of the Orb Claimants, still less to take decisions intended to give Dr Smith (who is not an Orb Claimant) the use of any assets .\u201d 95 I consider it likely that Dr Cochrane\u2019s Jersey Recall Applications are being conducted with the assistance, and likely at the direction of Dr Smith, who seeks to regain control of the property which is within Dr Cochrane and Orb\u2019s d\u00e9sastres . 96 On the basis of the foregoing, I respectfully ask the Court to grant the relief sought by Harbour in reliance upon the LCL Settlement Agreement, as set out at paragraph 5.1 above. 97 A second issue arising from an agreement affects both Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas, to the extent that they might otherwise be able to attack the Harbour IA on the basis of the PACCAR Decision. The 2014 Harbour Deed was signed from October 2014 onwards, and postdated the receipt of the assets under the IOM Settlement. Each of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas (amongst others) agreed that the recoveries under the IOM Settlement were to be treated as \u201cProceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings\u201d for the purposes of Cl 9.1 of the Harbour IA and were to be applied in accordance with the terms of that clause. Accordingly, each of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas are estopped by deed from contesting that position. In addition, the 2014 Harbour Deed is on any view not a DBA \u2013 it no longer relates to a future contingency, but regulates the effect of an event that had by that stage already happened. H. The abusive nature of the Smith Parties\u2019 attempt to seek to invalidate the Harbour IA 98 Harbour's position is that the Orb Claimants could have argued that the Harbour IA was a DBA and sought to undermine Harbour\u2019s entitlement under the agreement at any time after it was agreed (although possibly not immediately) . The DBA Regulations entered into force on 1 April 2013, and the Harbour IA was executed on 10 July 2013. As set out above, it is accepted that at that point, not even the Government believed that the DBA Regulations were going to apply",

As set out above, it is accepted that at that point, not even the Government believed that the DBA Regulations were going to apply to litigation funding agreements. 99 The litigation which gave rise to the PACCAR Decision (the \u201c Trucks Dispute \u201d) arose in the Competition Appeals Tribunal (the \u201c CAT \u201d). It is not necessary for me to explain the background to those proceedings, save that the hearing in front of the CAT at which the issue of whether litigation funding agreements were Damages Based Agreements took A1.5/50 35 place from 4 to 6 June 2019 (the \u201c Trucks Judgment (Funding)17\u201d). The Trucks Judgment (Funding) was handed down on 28 October 2019 , and subsequently the same arguments regarding the status of litigation funding agreements were ventilated before the Court of Appeal in relation to an application by the defendants in the Trucks Dispute for permission to appeal or alternatively for permission to bring proceedings for judicial review, a decision which was handed down on 5 March 2021 ( Paccar Inc. v RHA and UKTC [2021] EWCA Civ 299 (the \u201c PACCAR Court of Appeal Decision \u201d)).18 100 Both of these decisions made it clear that arguments about the status of litigation funding agreements at DBAs were \u2018live\u2019 and had been published in high profile judgments since late 2019. Both the Trucks Judgment (Funding) and the PACCAR Court of Appeal Decision also refer to an article published in the Cambridge Law Journal in 2014, by Professor Rachel Mulheron , title d \u201cEngland's unique approach to the self -regulation of third party funding: a critical analysis of recent developments \u201d (the \u201c Mulheron Analysis\u201d)19 (pages 520-553). The Mulheron Analysis, in my view , contains a thorough breakdown of the primary arguments which would, several years later, be advanced by the defendant parties in the lead up to the Trucks Judgment (Funding) , and later by those same parties in their application to the Supreme Court . 101 In particular, Prof. Mulheron expends several pages on a detailed analysis of question of whether litigation funders, according t o the rules of statutory interpretation, provide \u201c claims management services \u201d, as defined in section 58AA of the CLSA 1990. While she concedes that the drafting of the relevant provisions may give rise to a degree of uncertainty, she concludes that \u201cthe author considers that any application which sought to render a LFA unenforceable because it did not meet the requirements of the DBA Regulations 2013 would be bound to fail. \u201d Professor Mulheron also noted that the possibility that funding agreements were caug ht by the DBA Regulations 2013 had been \u201c ventured in some quarters since the implementation of the 17 https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/CAT/2019/26.html 18 https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/2021/299.html , at paragraph 80(2) \u201cThe Tribunal next pointed out that the argument now advanced by DAF \"is not altogether novel\": see [37]. In particular, the issue was raised by Professor Rachel Mul heron, who is \"one of the leading academics in the field of civil procedure\", in an influent ial article in the Cambridge Law Journal in 2014: see England's unique approach to the self regulation of third party funding: a critical analysis of recent developments [2014] CL J 570 at 592-595.

A1.5/51 36 DBA Regulations 2013 \u201d.20 The author also notes that the debate \u201c has been the subject of comment at several conferences since the Jackson reforms took effect .\u201d21 102 While I understand that Professor Mulheron reached the conclusion that litigation funding agreements were very unlikely to qualify as damages based agreement s, this very clearly shows that the arguments raised by the parties to the PACCAR Decision were not novel, and could have been run on behalf of the Orb Claimants , Dr Cochrane , or any other party to these proceedings . 103 I also note that in an open letter to the Lord Chancellor of 16 April 2024 (pages 554-555), to which Mr Thomas and Dr Smith appended their signatures and which sought to persuade the Government not to introduce the retrospective aspects of the Litigation Funding (Enforceability) Bill , the authors concede that \u201c The law has always been that litigation funders provide claims management services and therefore their LFAs are DBAs (provided Section 58AA(3) of the CLSA 1990 is engaged) and are subject to regulatio n. The Supreme Court in PACCAR simply confirmed this position. That the point had not been judicially considered before is irrelevant: Professor Rachel Mulheron (whose views the litigation funders will be well aware) first raised the point almost a decade ago.\u201d 104 Despite Professor Mulheron\u2019s conclusions, she and those working with her clearly remained concerned that greater clarity was required in this area, and undertook to engage with the Civil Justice Council on a consultation called the Damages Based Agreements Reform Project, the conclusions of which were published in August 2015 (the \u201c CJC DBA Report \u201d).22 The aim of this consultation was to make recommendations to the government regarding revisions to the DBA Regulations 2013, with a view to the enactment of the DBA Regulations 2015. 105 In the event, the DBA Regulations 2015 were never adopted. However, noting that while \u201cit was extremely unlikely that Third Party Funders were inadvertently covered by the 2013 DBA Regulations \u2026 the intent of the Ministry of Justice to set any remote residual uncertainty about the point at nought was noted \u201d. The authors recommended specifically excluding litigation funders in the revised report. 20 Mulheron Analysis, page 3, paragraph 1 21 Ibid, footnote 140 22 https://www.judiciary.uk/wp -content/uploads/2015/09/dba -reform -project -cjc-aug-2015.pdf A1.5/52 37 106 I note that until mid-2016 , the Orb Claimants were represented by Stewarts Law, a firm with a very detailed understanding of litigation funding, and who were no doubt aware of the principles I outline above. It is also evident to me, however, that the Orb Claimants would have had n o commercial interest seeking to undermine the Harbour IA while they were represented by Stewarts. Harbour complied with the Harbour IA fully and provided the Orb claimants with around \u00a35.2m of litigation funding. 107 However, despite the deterioration of the relationship between the Orb Claimants and Harbour, which ultimately resulted in Harbour successfully establishing its rights under the Harbour IA at the Directed Trial, neither",

Their opportunities to do so were extremely extensive, given the lengthy nature of these proceedings. I set out at Annex 1 a timetable of the relevant procedural steps in these proceedings. This clearly shows that the Orb Claimants have had numerous opportunities to advance an argument as to the enforceability of the Harbour IA , from mid-2017 (when the first \u201c assets and claims position papers\u201d were produced by the parties, including the Orb Claimants) until July 2021 when the opportunity to appeal the Consequentials Order expired. 108 In particular, the Orb Claimants had multiple opportunities during the lead up to the Directed Trial to advance claims in respect of the validity of the Harbour IA , including : 108.1 Five C ase Management Conference ( CMC ) hearings. The purpose of three of those CMCs was to establish the scope of assets and issues to be determined at the Directed Trial. 108.2 Pursuant to court order s, at least three requirements for parties to file statements outlining their position, including by way of a statement of case or position paper, and consequential amendments to the same. Applications to amend parties\u2019 pleadings were being made as late as 31 December 2020 following the PTR , at which time LCL (one of the Smith Parties) applied to amend its statement of case. 108.3 Witness statements of fact, both trial witness statements and those in respect of interlocutory applications such as, for example , the guillotine hearing that culminated in the assets being identified as the subject matter of the Directed Trial. A1.5/53 38 108.4 The Directed Trial itself, which spanned 7 weeks, represented a significant opportunity for the Orb Claimants to advance their position. It should be noted that during the trial period, extensive submissions on a wide range of issues were put forward by numerous parties to the litigation , in some instances for the first time. No stone was left unturned, and all matters raised were exhaustively deliberated. 109 I note also that Harbour\u2019s Statement of Case in these proceedings of 29 November 2017 stated at paragraph 7 that \u201c Harbour intends to rely upon the Harbour Funding Agreement in these proceedings for its full terms and true effect \u201d. It went on at paragraph 15 to state that \u201c Harbour entered into the Harbour Funding Agreement in good faith, in the ordinary course of business and on ordinary terms (including terms as to its remuneration and success fee )\u2026\u201d. 110 In response, Messrs Thomas and Taylor in their Responsive Statement of Case of 28 July 2019 , at paragraph 24, stated that \u201c These Respondents accept a s accurate in all material respects the summary of the Harbour Funding Agreement given in paragraphs 5 to 16 of Harbour\u2019s Statement of Case dated 29 November 2017\u2026 \u201d 111 It is notable that t he SFO\u2019s responsive statement of case",

The Viscount supports Harbour\u2019s case in relation to the Harbour Funding Agreement at paras 55 -65 of her SOC \u2026. 8. As for the contentions advanced by certain other Interested Parties in relation to the Harbour Funding Agreement : a. It is noted t hat no Interested Party challenges the validity of the Harbour Funding Agreement \u2026\u201d 113 It is clear that the validity and enforceability of the Harbour IA was relied upon by Harbour from the outset of these proceedings, and that no party chose to actively challenge Harbour\u2019s position. It is entirely unsurprising, therefore, that the Directed Trial did not need expressly to confirm that status . A1.5/54 39 114 Accordingly, the Smith Parties have had ample opportunities to argue that the Harbour IA was subject to the DBA regulations and failed to do so. I would respectfully suggest that these matters are res judicata, or give rise to cause of action or issue estoppel, or that it would be abusive , for reasons that will be expanded upon in submissions, for them to be allowed to do so now. I. The Severability of the Harbour IA 115 Given the PACCAR Decision , if the above points do not determine the matter in Harbour\u2019s favour, there appears to be a risk that the Harbour IA would be found by a court to be a non -compliant DBA. I note, however, that t he Harbour IA also includes a clause headed \u201cSeverability\u201d, which provides that: \u201cIf any term or provision in this Agreement shall in whole or in part be held to any extent to be illegal or unenforceable under any enactment or rule of law, that term or provision or part shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement a nd the enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected \u201d. 116 It is my understanding that the percentage -based recovery provisions in Schedule 2 are capable of being severed , such that the agreement remains enforceable . I do not seek to make submissions in this witness statement as to the legal position in respect of sever ability . However I will , for the Court\u2019s convenience, set out below my understanding of how this would operate in practice. 117 Harbour\u2019s entitlement in respect of any proceeds up to \u00a340 million is calculated on a n alternative basis , depending on when such proceeds are received. In respect of this agreement, the initial period in respect of proceeds received either 6 or 12 months after the agreement was signed, expired in 10 July 201 3, over 10 years ago. 118",

In respect of this agreement, the initial period in respect of proceeds received either 6 or 12 months after the agreement was signed, expired in 10 July 201 3, over 10 years ago. 118 The final two rows are intended to determine Harbour\u2019s recoveries if the proceeds exceed \u00a340 million, and are calculated on a percentage basis only. It is also worth noting, although not a necessary factor in this exercise, that Harbour does not expect the proceeds to exceed \u00a340 million , indeed they are likely to be significantly less , not least because the costs of the relevant office holders charged with realising the assets have been significantly inflated by the actions of the Smith Parties since the Di rected Trial . A1.5/55 40 119 As long ago as 2 July 2021, not long after the Directed Trial Judgment, my firm wrote to Messrs Thomas and Taylor setting out the likely proceeds, including estimated values of the relevant assets (which are now signifi cantly out of date, and which are likely to be significantly reduced as at today\u2019s date) (pages 556-563). We also made it clear that Harbour expected its minimum return to be calculated on the basis of the multiples included in Schedule 2. It should be noted that the Orb Claimants (Messrs Tho mas and Taylor in particular) have on several occasions asserted that they expect the proceeds to be considerably more than \u00a340 million. In any event , I respectfully suggest that such dispute is not material at this stage. 120 It is Harbour\u2019s belief that the sections of Schedule 2 which contain a percentage based recovery can be severed from the Harbour IA, to the extent that they are \u201cillegal or unenforceable\u201d , in accordance with the severability provisions of the agreement . This is a straightforward exercise in contractual in terpretation which does not require reference to the general common law principles concerning severance , or to satisfy th e general common law test . In particular , in the contractual interpretation context the court is not limited to deletions, it does not matter whether there is surplus language left over and there is no need to consider whether the overall balance of the contract remains the sa me. 121 However, Harbour also intends to argue in the alternative that the general common law test can be satisfied in any event . I set out below another version of Schedule 2 which demonstrates where such modifications are necessary (the \u201c Modified Schedule 2 \u201d). I note also that in pre -action correspondence, having received the draft of this Application, Marriot Harrison has indicated that Mr Thomas disagrees with Harbour application of the principles of severability in respect of the proposed Modified Schedule 2. These objections would only appear to have application to the common law approach not the exercise in contractual interpretation referred to above. Harbour reserves its position in this regard, including as to the further modification of Schedule 2 and any arguments about how the surviving wording may be interpreted , pending receipt of Mr Thomas\u2019s responsive evidence. A1.5/56 41 122 It is my understanding that, for severance to be possible at common law , three requirements must be satisfied: 122.1 First, it must be possible to remove the offending language without adding to or modifying other language (known as",

A1.5/57 42 122.3 Third, the resulting contract must not be of a different nature to the original agreement, such that it is not the sort of contract that the parties entered into at all. 123 As to the Blue Pencil Test, I would respectfully suggest to the Court that the Modified Schedule 2 provisions are workable, and do not require any re -writing or amendment in order to be understood. In fact, they read as plain English, as if the severed provisions had never been included. The nature of the agreement has not changed . 124 The only other passage in the Harbour IA which refers to Harbour\u2019s entitlement to a percentage of proceeds is contained within Clause 10 .2(e): \u201c10.2 Where, pursuant to clause 4.2(i), the Claimants receive a recommendation from the Legal Representatives to accept an offer of Settlement made on behalf of one or more Defendants (the \"Recommended Offer\") but the Claimants elect to reject the Recommended Offer, if the Proceeds eventually recovered from such Defend ant or Defendants are less than the amount of the Recommended Offer, the Claimants shall hold such Proceeds on bare Trust absolutely for the benefit of HF2 and the Claimants and to the extent of their interests as Trust Beneficiaries The Claimants shall ad ditionally keep such Proceeds separate from the Claimants' own funds and shall apply the Proceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings in the following order upon receipt of such Proceeds: (a) deduct all stamp duties, bank charges and currency exchange costs payable by the Claimants relating to or arising out of any such Success in the Proceedings; (b) pay to HF2 the HF2 Investment; (c) pay any other sums due in respect of Claimants' Legal Costs; (d) pay to the Legal Representatives, Barristers or other third parties with whom the Claimants have concluded a Legal Costs Agreement any success fee or costs uplift payable under any such Legal Costs Agreement; (e) pay to HF2 any amount due to it in its capacity as Trust Beneficiary pursuant to Schedule 2 save that the percentage of Proceeds payable to HF2 shall be calculated by reference to the amount of the Recommended Offer and not by reference to the amount o f the Proceeds; and A1.5/58 43 (f) pay to the Claimants any remaining amount which the Claimants shall receive in their capacity as Trust Beneficiaries .\u201d 125 All that is required in this section of the agreement is the deletion of the second half of Clause 10.2(e), from the words \u201c save that \u201d to the end of the clause and in any event Clause 10.2(e) has no relevance to the current situation . Again , the balance of the clause remains entirely coherent , without any further amendments necessary. 126 I note that the Thomas Letter Before Action also refers to the provisions of Clause",

Again , the balance of the clause remains entirely coherent , without any further amendments necessary. 126 I note that the Thomas Letter Before Action also refers to the provisions of Clause 14 of the Harbour IA . I understand the implication of the letter to be that , according to Mr Thomas, Clause 14.4(a)(ii) of the Harbour IA also contains provisions that cause Harbour\u2019s return to be \u201cdetermined by reference to the amount of the financial benefit obtained by the recipient \u201d, in accordance with the third of the DBA requirements of the CLSA 1990. However, I do not believe this to be the case (and again it has no relevance to the current situation) . 127 Clause 14 .4 reads as follows: \u201c14.4 In the event that the Claimants continue with the Proceedings after the Termination Date and the Claimants subsequently Succeed in such Proceedings, the Claimants agree on a joint and several basis that: (a) they will hold all Proceeds on bare Trust absolutely for the Claimants and HF2 and to the extent of their interests as Trust Beneficiaries, such Proceeds will be kept separate from the Claimants' own funds and the Claimants shall as trustee of the Trus t forthwith pay to HF2 an amount from the Proceeds corresponding to: (i) the HF2 Investment up to the Termination Date; and (ii) a sum calculated by applying 10% per annum on the amounts referred to in subclause 14.4(a)(i), calculated from the date of each payment out (or assumption of liability for Adverse Costs) by HF2 to the date of refund to HF2 by the Claimants. (b) The provisions of clauses 8 and 9 and payment to HF2 under the Trust, will apply as if this Agreement had continued in force, SAVE THAT the amount of Proceeds payable to HF2 under Schedule 2 shall be fixed by reference to the Termination Date and not t he date of receipt of monies by HF2 following Success in the Proceedings; and A1.5/59 44 (c) the Claimants shall not be obliged to make payments to HF2 under the terms of this Trust that are more than the Proceeds it recovers. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause 14.4 shall survive any termination of this Agreement .\u201d 128 Although the Thomas Letter Before Action does not clearly set out the basis of Mr Thomas\u2019s assertion in relation to this provision, I assume that Mr Thomas\u2019s case is that a reference in 14.4(a)(ii) to a sum of 10% per annum due to Harbour renders this clause a DBA provision in that by its nature a percentage is determined by to a separate figure. However, the figure which determines the amount of the percentage due in this instance is Harbour\u2019s investment, rather than the amount of any proceeds. This is eff ectively a provision for Harbour to recover interest on its investment in the instance that the Harbour IA is terminated before proceeds are received by the Orb Claimants. Therefore by definition , if this clause were to be invoked, the Orb Claimants would have not yet received any financial benefit for Harbour\u2019s return to be calculated by reference to. I do not understand the third criterion of the CLSA 1990 to be intended to refer to this scenario, therefore there is no need to consider the severance of this provision.",

I do not understand the third criterion of the CLSA 1990 to be intended to refer to this scenario, therefore there is no need to consider the severance of this provision. 129 Finall y, I also understand Mr Thom as to intend to argue that the provisions of part of Clause 9 of the Harbour IA would render the agreement a DBA, specifically Clause 9.3. Mr Thomas\u2019s position has not been made completely clear in correspondence , and as such Harbour reserves its position and will respond more fully in due course if necessary . 130 As to the second requirement of the severability test , which is that the resulting contract should still be supported by adequate consideration, I would respectfully suggest that this would be satisfied. Harbour would still be providing consideration by way of its promise to provide funding to the Orb Claimants (and the provision of funding) , and the Orb Claimants would be providing consideration by way of their promise to hold on trust the Proceeds on Success, and to pay to Harbour, out of those proceeds, (1) the amount of the investment and (2) a return, calculated now as a multiple of Harbour\u2019s investment . 131 As to the third requirement (that the nature of the agreement should not be altered such that it becomes quite different to that originally agreed), as I outline above, the Harbour IA only requires amend ment in very limited respects . The essence of the agreement remains unchanged , namely that Harbour agree d to fund the Orb Claimants in exchange A1.5/60 45 for a return should Proceeds be recovered. The potential change in Harbour\u2019s entitlement is a matter of degree, and not a change in the inherent commercial nature of the agreement . 132 In the alternative, Harbour\u2019s case will be that at a bare minimum, its contractual right to repayment of the investment (plus interest at 10% per annum as stipulated in clause 17.1 of the Harbour IA )24 remains unimpaired. This is specified in Cl 9.1(b) , and is unaffected by any finding that the return elements of the Harbour IA are unenforceable. 133 I note that the severance approach is not the only available analysis of how to deal with statutory unenforceability. It will be a matter of submission as to whether it is the correct framework within which to assess the issue, as opposed, by way of example only, to an interpretation of the Harbour IA which locates the DBA within a confined portion of the larger whole and which does not have effects outside of that portion. 134 Finally, Mr Thomas has suggested that even if Harbour\u2019s case on severa nce succeeds, the resulting agreement must somehow conform to the requirements of the CLSA 1990. Mr Thomas has not explained this principle and as such it would be premature for Harbour\u2019s position to be fully developed here. That said , Harbour would consider the starting point to be that if the Harbour IA is no t a DBA following one of the approaches as set out above , it is not required to meet any criteria set out in S.58AA of the CLSA 1990.

J. Harbour\u2019s detrimental reliance on the Harbour IA 135 Harbour has detrimentally relied upon its understanding that the Harbour IA was an enforceable agreement which conferred upon it particular proprietary rights . In these proceedings, as I note above, H arbour funded the Orb Claimants in the amount of approximately \u00a35.2 million, and has since spent several times that amount enforcing its rights under the Harbour IA. 136 In total, Harbour has expended approximately \u00a3 16.7 million (including amounts advanced by Harbour to the Viscount) as of the date of this evidence , and expects to expend considerably more on dealing with further actions which have been initiated by the Smith Parties. Additionally, the continuing efforts of the Smith Parties and other related individuals to resist the work of court -appo inted office holders w ill further inflate the costs 24 Harbour's position is that contractual interest also accrues pursuant to clause 17.1 in respect of its entire entitlement , including returns on its investment provided for in Schedule 2 of the Harbour IA, should the court find in its favour on this application. A1.5/61 46 associated with managing and realising the assets which were the subject of the Directed Trial and depress ultimate recoveries . 137 The other Settlement Parties submitted their relevant costs to the Court at the time of the costs consequentials hearing following the Directed Trial. These represent only a partial picture of the total costs that those parties have expended , as they reflected only their legal costs incurred during the Directed Trial , i.e. to 2021 . These totals have undoubtedly increased significantly in the subsequent years (including a total of around \u00a31.16 million expended by the Settlement Parties in the context of the Part 8 Claim). 137.1 Stewarts Law: \u00a32.3 million 137.2 The Viscount: \u00a32.5 million 137.3 The SFO: \u00a31.8 million 137.4 The Joint Liquidators: \u00a33.4 million 137.5 The Enforcement Receivers: \u00a33.8 million K. Limitation 138 Harbour will also submit that, as determined in the Directed Trial, Harbour\u2019s right to recovery under the Harbour IA was engaged (at the latest) on 29 April 2016, at the time of execution of a settlement between Dr Smith, Dr Cochrane and Mr Andrew Ruhan (t he \u201cGeneva Settlement \u201d) (the Confidential Deed, which is one of the Geneva Settlement documents is at pages 564-568), which brought to an end the Orb Litigation (which was itself dismissed by way of consent order on 5 May 2016). 139 As such, the time period for the Orb Claimants to contend that the Harbour IA was unenforceable began at the date of the Geneva Settlement, and ended in April 2022, well after the conclusion of the Directed Trial, and during the period in which the Orb Claimants\u2019 c hallenges to the Directed Trial Judgment were well underway. 140 Harbour\u2019s limitation submissions will be developed in due course, but I also note here that, as I set out above, the potential arguments regarding the applicability of the DBA Regulations 2013 to the Harbour IA were publicly available since around the time of the Mulheron Analysis in 2014. As such, the Orb Claimants could have discovered the basis A1.5/62 47 for their potential cause of action at any time from that point in 2014 onwards, and certainly by April 2016. 141",

Harbour\u2019s position in this regard is reserved pending the full articulation by Mr Thomas of the relief he seeks , which depends on how he frames his case as to the basis for any right of recovery \u2013 obviously different limitation periods may apply depending on how this is put . This reservation also extends to Harbour\u2019s right to argue that Mr Thomas is barred by laches from obtaining the relief he seeks , in the circumstances of this case, whether or not a limitation period applies to the relief he seeks . 142 Finally, in pre -action correspondence, Marriott Harrison has indicated that Mr Thomas intends to argue that should his action be time barred, the same should apply to this application by Harbour. Harbour\u2019s position will be developed in submission in due course, but I note that this appears to be a misconceived interpretation of the relief sought by Harbour in this application. Primarily, Harbour seeks declaration s that Mr Thomas, Dr Cochrane or any other party\u2019s actions to undermine the Harbour IA are abusi ve or incorrect, and only if Harbour does not succeed on those grounds, that those parties\u2019 applications are time -barred in terms of advancing the substantive arguments . L. Dr Cochrane\u2019s standing and the Debarring/Stay Directions 143 As she was declared en d\u00e9sastre in November 2016 , Dr Cochrane\u2019s personal interests in these proceedings have been represented by the Viscount . I note, however, that Dr Cochrane executed the LCL Settlement Deed in her personal capacity. 144 In the circumstances, without prejudice to its rights more generally, Harbour is prepared to take a pragmatic position and would not object to Dr Cochrane being permitted to address the Court on the matters dealt with in this application . 145 Given th e Thomas Letter Before Action, it seems that Mr Thomas is likely to seek to oppose Harbour\u2019s application and seek relief that is relevant to the other Orb Claimants as well as himself . In this regard, Harbour \u2019s position is that Mr Thomas remains bound by and must comply , in full, with the terms of the Debarring/Stay Directions before any application or request for relief he makes can proceed. M. Conclusions A1.5/63 48 146 I respectfully submit that Harbour\u2019s present application should be granted on one or more of the bases I set out above. 147 Subject to the Court\u2019s approach in relation to, and determination of, the above matters, further issues may need to be addressed or raised, or directions given, in respect of which Harbour\u2019s position is fully reserved. These include, for example : (a) whether the Guarantee entered into between Harbour and Dr Cochrane renders Dr Cochrane liable for any unenforceable obligations under the Harbour IA in any event , and whether Harbour can hold Dr Cochrane, Mr Thomas and Mr Taylor liable for breach of the represe ntations and warranties at Cl 3.1(g) of the Harbour IA under which they promised that the obligations assumed were \u201clegal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations\u201d in the amount",

Her actions include initially refusing to sign transfer documents for the shares, initially refusing to appoint the Enforcement Receivers as directors and sign other documents and indicating an intention to oppose the Attorney General of Jersey's representation to vary the saisie judiciaire made by the Royal Court of Jersey on 24 November 2016 to permit the transfer of shares in Casa Coloniches to the Enforcement Receivers which has caused, and continues to cause, significant delay and cost.25 Ongoing (from February 2021) Obstruction by associates of Smith in bringing claims against companies controlled by the Enforcement Receivers and opposing the recognition of the Enforcement Receivers and Directed Trial Judgment in proceedings in the Republic of the Marshall Islands Smith parties and Thomas In February 2021, Simon Cooper and Simon McNally commenced claims against SMA and GACH (both Non -Arena Companies) in the Republic of the Marshall Islands which the Enforcement Receivers on behalf of SMA and GACH opposed. In April 2021, the Enforcement Rece ivers applied for recognition of their appointment. In June 2021, LCL sought to consent to a claim brought by Cooper and McNally that includer a transfer of the shares of the Non Arena Companies (determined in the Directed Trial to be held for Dr Smith and payable to Confiscation Order) to SMA and GACH, which the Smith parties (including Mr Thomas) claimed were not controlled by the Enforcement Receivers but by Thomas or entities connected with them. In November 2021, Minardi Investments Limited (then actin g by Smith associates) brought a further claim against SMA (acting by the Enforcement Receivers). The opposition to recognition of the Enforcement Receivers and the outcome of the Directed Trial continues , resulting in significant delay and costs26. 25 Paragraph 5.7.2 of MR26 (pages 569-623, page 599) 26 Paragraphs 5.2.7 and 5.2.8 of MR26 (page 585-586).

A1.5/67 52 March 2022 ongoing Obstruction of vacant possession of Flats 11, 12, 19, 20 and 21 Hamilton House27 Certain of the LCL Parties Dr Smith, Robert Morris, Imogen Smith and Iona Smith, all parties to the LCL Settlement Agreement , were required to give vacant possession of these flats, pursuant to its terms. Despite notice being given to them by the Enforcement Receivers , vacant possession was actively resisted, including by way of court applications, causing significant cost and delay. As noted above, despite vacant possession having ultimately been obtained by the Enforcement Receivers, Dr Smith has again claimed rights over these properties, as a result of the PACCAR decision. 11 May 2022 Part 8 Claim commenced by Messrs Thomas and Taylor by which they sought to appoint Mr Ticehurst as trustee of the Harbour Trust for an improper purpose \u201cthe Part 8 Claim \u201d) Thomas As part of their efforts to frustrate the Directed Trial, Messrs Thomas and Taylor (with the support and funding of Smith and his associates) sought to enforce certain rights as trustees of the trust arising out of the Harbour Investment Agreement by way of a Part 8 claim . Despite a previous indication from Foxton J that Messrs Thomas and Taylor were not suitable trustees, given their prior unlawful receipt of trust funds, they acted in direct contravention of the Judge\u2019s indications by both seeking to act as trustees, and by improperly appointing a further trustee (Mr Ticehurst) . After a further trial which took place in late 2022, again in front of Foxton J, Messrs Thomas and Taylor were found to have been acting in concert with Smith and against the interests of the principal beneficiaries of the Harbour Trust, and were removed as trustees. All of Messrs Thomas and Taylors\u2019 arguments failed, the Settlement Parties were forced to incur significant additional costs of over \u00a31m, and the additional litigation caused a significant delay in the ongoing enforcement efforts of the Office Holders. 20 June 2022 Contempt Application against Mr Thomas The Enforcement Receivers filed a contempt application against Mr Thomas28 on the following grounds: \u2022 Inciting LCL to purport to transfer its shares in SMA and GACH to the \u201cjoint trustees of the Orb Claimants Trust \u201d; \u2022 Purporting to accept board appointments for SMA and GACH; and \u2022 Purporting to act as a director of SMA and GACH by agreeing to stay the RMI proceedings . 27 Please see footnote 7 of 4.3.1.2 of the 6th Receivership Order R eport dated 12 July 2024 ( pages 624-663, page 63 5) 28 Paragraph 4.2.12 of MR25 (pages 664 \u2013 716, page 67 9) A1.5/68 53 Ultimately, Mr Thomas carried out the actions required by the Enforcement Receivers, and the contempt application was compromised with costs ordered in favour of the Enforcement Receivers. 29 July 2022 29 July 2022 Dr Smith contempt of court conviction Dr Smith Dr Smith was convicted of contempt of court in July 2022 in respect of breaches of a restraint order obtained by the SFO, which restricted his access to certain bank accounts.

Foxton J rejected those efforts in a Judgment dated 28 February 2023 ([2023] EWHC 428 (Comm)) (the \u201cSMA Judgment \u201d) which found amongst other things that: \u201c19. I have no doubt that the approach taken by those behind Minardi and those behind BKV (to extent that they are different), was co -ordinated, and represented a calculated attempt to delay the hearing and the orders which the Harcus Parker Parties seek. Those individuals should be in no doubt as to the importance which the court attaches to ensuring that its processes are not misused and its orders are complied with, and the full range of the court's powers to serve these ends \u2026 103. As will be apparent from the foregoing, there is a real risk in this case that individuals who are bound by, but unhappy with, the outcome of the Directed Trial have been and are continuing to instigate proceedings and applications in these proceeding s and elsewhere to challenge the outcome of the Directed Trial or by way of a collateral attack on its conclusions. The scale of these activities and the legal costs and court time they are consuming, mean that considerable vigilance will be required on th e court's part to ensure that its judgments are respected and its processes are not abused. 104. If activities of this kind continue, there will need to be careful consideration of a number of matters, including: i) whether there are any individuals who may have breached court orders and undertakings and, if so, whether the court's committal jurisdiction should be engaged; 29 Paragraph 3.4.3 of MR 26 (page 581). The court\u2019s decision is summarised in this link: Convicted fraudster found to be in contempt of court - Serious Fraud Office (sfo.gov.uk) A1.5/69 54 ii) whether officers of the court should be given control of any companies which have changed hands in questionable circumstances, and which are being used in this process; iii) whether further injunctions could or should be granted against individuals where there is a sufficiently arguable case that they are engaged in activities intended to challenge a judgment which is binding upon them; iv) the consequences of undischarged costs orders in the litigation to date; and v) who has been funding these various applications and whether any orders against the funding parties or those controlling them would be appropriate. 31 January 2023 Assignment Application resulting in the Debarring/ Stay Order Thomas Despite Foxton J\u2019s clear direction regarding further collusion and frustration, Messrs Thomas and Taylor sought to bring a further application against Harbour and the other Settlement Parties in early 2023. This application sought an order for the assignment of claims to certain assets identified in the Consequentials Order, currently under the control of office holders. Foxton J issued directions on 31 March 2023 to the effect that Thomas and Taylor were not permitted to bring any further actions against the Settlement Parties without attending a preliminary hearing",

Pursuant to a judgment dated 29 November 2023, Mr Thomas was held to have committed a contempt of court. August 2023 - ongoing Obstruction by Dr Cochrane and other Smith associates in respect of C\u2019an Agata and Son Montserrat (the \u201cSpanish Properties \u201d) Dr Cochrane Dr Smith Thomas Stickler Two subsidiaries of Buena Vida Living 2 B.V ( \u201cBVL2 \u201d), Conor and Agata, both hold registered title to the Spanish Properties. The Enforcement Receivers commenced eviction proceedings against Dr Cochrane and Mr Jansen (Dr Smith\u2019s associate who purportedly occupied the property pursuant to an agreement A1.5/70 55 with Dr Cochrane). This application succeeded in the Spanish Court in June 2023 and Dr Cochrane was ordered to pay 108,000 euros to Agata (the \"Spanish Judgment\"), but her eviction was automatically suspended whilst she appealed the Spanish Judgment. In the end, the Spanish Court acceded to the Receivers (as directors of Agata) submission that Dr Cochrane's appeal should be struck out which it was earlier this year. According to the Enforcement Receivers, Mr Thomas asserts that the shares of Agata and Conor (or their proceeds) are (in some way) the property of the \u201cOrb Claimants\u201d held for the Harbour Trust. A summary of the extensive correspondence from Dr Cochrane who threatens litigation in respect of the Spanish Properties30, is as follows: On 11 August 2023, Dr Cochrane wrote to Bernardo Oliver, an architect who is engaged by the Receivers (as directors of Conor) in connection with the sale of Son Monserrat, noting Mr Oliver\u2019s conversation earlier that day with Dr Smith and asserting: a. that the property and Conor are \u201chers\u201d following their lawful transfer to her pursuant to the terms of the Isle of Man Settlement (with 62.5% owned by her and 37.5% owned by Messrs Thomas and Taylor); b. that Will Besga of Mallorca Law SL (\u201cMallorca Law\u201d) and the Enforcement Receivers had conspired to forge a shareholder resolution to remove Gail Cochrane and Ms Stickler as joint directors of Conor and Agata without their consent, with such forgery having been reported to the Mallorcan authorities and Miguel Games of Pinto Rui z & Del Valle having been instructed to bring proceedings against Mr Besga for fraud; c. that Mr Besga and the Enforcement Receivers\u2019 actions in this regard were part of the wider \u201cstrategy of unlawful interference in the",

On 15 August 2023, Dr Smith wrote to the Receivers to assert that he had been \u201c asked to assist the Orb Claimants to finish the redevelopment of Son Monserrat and to refurbish C\u2019an Agata \u201d, to confirm that he had moved into C\u2019an Agata (without the Receivers\u2019 consent as directors of Agata) and to request that the Receivers \u201c cease orchestrating interference\u201d with Agata and Conor. 30 Paragraphs 4.6.10 to 4.6. 10.26 of MR24 (pages 717 \u2013 768, pages 73 7 - 742).

On 21 August 2023 (at 11.30am), Dr Smith wrote to the Receivers and repeated many of the unsubstantiated allegations made in Gail Cochrane\u2019s letters of 11 and 17 August 2023 and threatening to commence proceedings in Spain against the Receivers and Mr Besga if the Receivers did not resign as dir ectors of Agata and Conor. The Enforcement Receivers provided robust responses to these letters on 21 August 2023. On 23 August 2023 (at 10.47am), Dr Cochrane wrote to the Enforcement Receivers alleging that their appointments as directors of Agata and Conor had occurred as a result of a forged shareholder resolution, suggesting that the Receivers\u2019 correspondence with her was \u201cbullying, threatening and demeaning\u201d and asserting that the PACCAR decision confirmed that the shares in Agata and Conor are the property of the Orb Claimants.

Administration application 1 In the context of the Orb Claimants\u2019 failure to honour the terms of the Harbour IA, as addressed in the Directed Trial Judgment, Harbour issued formal demands in Jersey against Orb by letters dated 17 and 26 August 2016 (pages 771-779), and pursuant to these demands, Orb was informed that failing settlement, an application would be made for the appointment of an administrator. 2 Following the formal demand upon Orb referred to above, Harbour applied to the Royal Court of Jersey (the \u201c Royal Court \u201d) for a letter of request to the English High Court seeking an administration order in respect of Orb. The Royal Court's judgment on that application was dated 28 September 2016, Representation of Harbour v Orb [2016] JRC 171 (\u201c the Administration Judgment \u201d) (pages 780-795). 3 In paragraph 40 of the Administration J udgment, the Royal Court noted as follows: - \u201cIn her written responses to the formal demands made by Harbour, Dr Cochrane denies any debt being due by ORB to Harbour, although that denial is not repeated in her affidavit of 7th September, 2016, filed in response to Harbour\u2019s application. Indeed, and perhaps significantly, she says nothing in that affidavit about Harbour\u2019s claim or whether or not it is accepted by ORB.

Indeed, and perhaps significantly, she says nothing in that affidavit about Harbour\u2019s claim or whether or not it is accepted by ORB. Furthermore, in his skeleton argument, Advocate Nicholls, representing ORB, makes no reference at all to Harbour\u2019s claim and whether or not it is accepted by ORB. His submissions are limited entirely to the lack of any evidence of ORB having assets within England and Wales, a requisite, he says, for any letter of request to be issued. Advocate Nicholls did not appear at the hearing on the 14th September, 2016, and therefore the Court was unable to press him on the point, but if ORB had a genuine defence to Harbour\u2019s claim, it would be surprising in the extreme for that defence not to be mentioned, and indeed, given some prominence.\u201d 4 The Royal Court concluded that Harbour was a creditor of Orb with a liquidated claim and that Orb was cash flow insolvent. It nevertheless decided in its discretion not to issue a letter of request on the ground that, given Orb\u2019s incorporation in Jersey an d other matters, a d\u00e9sastre would be the preferable way of proceeding, II. D\u00e9sastre application A1.5/75 60 5 Following the Administration Judgment, Harbour made a formal demand on Dr Cochrane under the terms of her personal guarantee of the obligations of Orb that I describe above. 6 It then applied for declarations of d\u00e9sastre in respect of both Orb and Dr Cochrane. The matter was heard inter partes on 24 November 2016. The Royal Court granted the applications on 24 November 2016 for the reasons set out in a judgment dated 12 January 2017, Harbour v Orb [2017] JRC 007 (\u201c the D\u00e9sastre Judgment \u201d) (pages 796-809). 7 The Royal Court reminded itself (at para graph 13 of the D\u00e9sastre Judgment) that, in order for the Court to declare a d\u00e9sastre , a creditor must show that it has a liquidated claim (i.e. a certain debt which is not the subject of a genuine dispute or an arguable defence) which exceeds the minimum threshold of \u00a33,000 and the creditor must also show that the debtor is insolvent (def ined as meaning \u2018an inability to pay its debts as they fall due\u2019 i.e. on a cash flow basis) but has realisable assets. The Court said that its judgment should be read as a continuation of the Admi nistration judgment. 8 As to whether Harbour was a creditor with a liquidated claim against Orb, at paragraphs 19 - 21 of the D\u00e9sastre Judgment , the Royal Court held: \u201c19. Advocate Drummond, for Harbour, took the Court through a careful analysis, set out in his skeleton argument, of how Harbour\u2019s liquidated claim arose under the Funding Agreement, the Isle of Man Agreement, and the 2014 Agreement, the latter presenti ng an insurmountable hurdle for ORB and Dr Cochrane in that by that Agreement, to which they were a party, they had agreed that the assets recovered by Dr Cochrane under the Isle of Man Agreement (at least \u00a310m) would be treated as proceeds of the English proceedings Harbour had been funding, giving rise to an immediate liability on the part of ORB to repay the sums advanced, namely \u00a35,189,010.48, just short of the aggregate amount Harbour was committed to fund under the funding agreement.\u201d 9 The Court held that Harbour was indisputably owed",

It further held that Dr Cochrane had no reasonably arguable defence to the claim against her in this sum pursuant to her guarantee. 10 Having found that Orb had realisable assets, the Royal Court considered the position of Dr Cochrane at paragraph 32 of its judgment in the following terms: \u201cIn or around April 2016, Dr Cochrane signed a loan note in favour of Phoenix Group Foundation (\u201cPhoenix\u201d) in the sum of \u00a373.75m in which she represents that she is the ultimate owner of a number of A1.5/76 61 assets set out in Schedule 1 thereto. She also said in her affidavit of 7th September 2016, \u201cI am also privileged to be a very wealthy woman, with holdings in dozens of companies worldwide, including [ORB].\u201d 11 The Royal Court was satisfied that Dr Cochrane and Orb had realisable assets despite the appearance of a strategy to divert assets away from Orb. 12 The Court then considered a submission that Orb had a counterclaim against Harbour in relation to the Harbour IA which it was entitled to set off against any debt owed to Harbour. In this connection the Royal Court said as follows: \u201c44. If this was a genuine claim for \u00a373M, then it was inconceivable to us that no reference had been made to it in the previous proceedings before this Court, in which Dr Cochrane did file an affidavit (which made no reference to it) or at any time at all in the dealings between Orb and Dr Cochrane on the one part and Harbour on the other. It was inconceivable to us that, if the claim was genuine, Orb and Dr Cochrane were unable to give particulars of it sufficient to enable us to assess whether it was re asonably arguable. Furthermore, there was no explanation as to how such a substantial claim came to be filed before the High Court without legal advice a mere two days before the hearing. 45. These arguments had been put forward by Orb and Dr Cochrane at the last moment without any evidence being filed in support on their behalf. In our view, given the background of this matter, we would have expected at least an affidavit from Dr Cochrane to assist us in the exercise of our discretion, an affidavit upon which she would, of course, have been susceptible to cross -examination. She gave us no such assistance.\u201d 13 The Court concluded that to refuse or adjourn the applications for declarations of d\u00e9sastre would be unjust to Harbour and the other creditors. 14 Having regard for various other considerations , the Court held that the requirements for granting a declaration of d\u00e9sastre were met in respect of both Orb and Dr Cochrane and accordingly, on 24 November 2016, the Royal Court declared Orb and Dr Cochrane en d\u00e9sastre (pages 810-817). a. Events following the declaration en d\u00e9sastre 15 On 30 December 2016, Harbour filed a proof of debt in each of Orb and Dr Cochrane's respective d\u00e9sastres (pages 818-847).

Those proofs of debt have not yet been adjudicated by the Viscount. A1.5/77 62 16 The Viscount applied to the Royal Court to issue two letters of request to the English Court. Despite what Dr Cochrane had said in her affidavit for the bankruptcy hearing (pages 848-853), the Royal Court noted in its judgment of 16 February 2017 (pages 854- 858) (giving reasons for issuing those letters of request) that (paragraph 9): \"\u2026 Dr Cochrane has now asserted to the Viscount that she has very few assets. According to her recently completed personal questionnaire and statement of income and expenditure required under Article 18 of the Law, Dr Cochrane has advised that her only as sets consist of six pieces of jewellery, two shares in a company known as Bodega Limited (\u201cBodega\u201d) and an unknown value in a partnership, which the Viscount believes is a share in the medical practice from which she works. Other items of value currently in her possession, which include a substantial art and wine collection, a rib, several high -value motor vehicles and other chattels are said to be owned by Bodega, of which the 99.9% shareholder is said to be Litigation Capital Funding, a New York based en tity believed to be owned by Mr Anthony Smith, the brother of Dr Gerald Smith. Dr Smith is the former husband of Dr Cochrane and has twice been convicted of offences of fraud and served a prison sentence. Dr Smith has advised the Viscount that Orb does n ot have nor has it ever had any assets.\" 17 The judgment further noted that (paragraph 13): \"Following the declarations en d\u00e9sastre, creditors had submitted claims, together with supporting documents, against Dr Cochrane in the sum of \u00a3765,532,125 and against Orb in the sum of \u00a3562,889,913. The Viscount believes there is potentially some degree of duplication in the claims as some creditors have claimed against Dr Cochrane as guarantor of the obligations of Orb. Nevertheless, given the background described in the September judgment and the judgment of Popplewell J and the other matters referred t o above, the Viscount regards it as inconceivable that both Dr Cochrane and Orb have been able to acquire such colossal levels of debt without owning any of the assets listed by Harbour in its application for d\u00e9sastre. The Viscount also notes that Dr Coch rane and Orb are subject to ongoing and vigorously fought legal proceedings in England. Five such sets of proceedings are listed in her affidavit.\" b. Application for a retrospective extension of time to appeal 18 On 31 December 2019, Dr Cochrane applied for an extension of time in which to appeal against the declaration of d\u00e9sastre in her case (pages 859-863). This application first came before Birt JA as a single judge on 14 January 2020, who directed that the matter be brought to the full court (page 86 4). Dr Cochrane\u2019s application was subsequently listed for hearing during the week commencing 27 July 2020. A1.5/78 63 19 On 16 July 2020, Dr Cochrane applied for an adjournment, substantially on the basis that she had a short while earlier dismissed Advocate Blakeley and was planning to instruct a new firm of advocates (pages 865-867).",

Dr Cochrane\u2019s application was subsequently listed for hearing during the week commencing 27 July 2020. A1.5/78 63 19 On 16 July 2020, Dr Cochrane applied for an adjournment, substantially on the basis that she had a short while earlier dismissed Advocate Blakeley and was planning to instruct a new firm of advocates (pages 865-867). That application for an adjournment was refused by the Court of Appeal in a short judgment dated 20 July 2020 (Cochrane v Harbour Fund II LLP and the Viscount [2020] JCA 140A) (pages 868-872). The new firm was not in fact instructed and accordingly Dr Cochrane appeared as a litigant in person at the hearing. 20 On Friday 24 July 2020 \u2013 the matter being listed for hearing on Tuesday 28 July 2020 \u2013 Dr Cochrane sent to the Court an affidavit dated 23 July 2020 (pages 873-880) together with various exhibits. By a letter dated 27 July 2020 (pages 881-883), she purported to file two further documents. Her application to adduce those documents was rejected (pages 884- 920). 21 The Court of Appeal also noted that (paragraph 100): \"As to creditors, the Viscount states that the current value of claims in Dr Cochrane\u2019s d\u00e9sastre is approximately \u00a3304,293,400, albeit that she has not yet adjudicated upon the claims because she considers it unfair to put potential creditors to the cost o f proving their claims in circumstances where the current English litigation is likely to result in the effective adjudication of many of these claims and where, pending the outcome of those proceedings, the present assets are insufficient to lead to any d istribution.\" 22 The application for an extension of time was dismissed, the Jersey Court of Appeal finding: \"104. \u2026 Given the extremely lengthy delay (nearly three years), and our conclusion that the reasons given for that delay do not provide justification, we would only consider extending the time for appealing if the merits of the proposed appeal were overwhe lming (to use Beloff JA\u2019s expression). That is certainly not the case. As we have described earlier, we conclude that there are minimal prospects of Dr Cochrane being successful in showing that Harbour does not have a liquidated contractual claim in debt , or that she did not have realisable assets at the time of the d\u00e9sastre application. Even in relation to whether Harbour has a proprietary claim to the assets which are the subject of the current English litigation, any case mounted on appeal would be at best arguable; it is certainly not overwhelming. 105. The above factors are sufficient to lead to a rejection of this application. But when one adds in the factor that prejudice would be caused to Harbour and other parties if the application were to be allowed, the case for refusing to extend the time for appealing is unanswerable.\" A1.5/79 64 23 In a separate costs judgment, the Jersey Court of Appeal awarded costs against Dr Cochrane on the indemnity basis (pages 921-924). In respect of her application for an extension of time, it stated: \"7. In our judgment, the Applicant\u2019s conduct in pursuing the Application was unreasonable and takes the case out of the norm. We so conclude for the following reasons: (i) The delay was extreme (nearly 3 years when the time for appealing is 28 days) in circumstances where this Court found that there was no justification for this period of delay.

(iii) Not only was there extreme delay without justification but this Court found that the prospects of success of any appeal were minimal and that its pursuit would cause prejudice not only to Harbour but also to other parties to the current English litigation, who had all proceeded and incurred time and expense on the basis that the Applicant was en d\u00e9sastre and that the Viscount was accordingly entitled to act on her behalf. 24 Putting these matters together, we consider that pursuit of the Application was unreasonable and that it would not be a fair result for Harbour only to be able to recover the costs which it has incurred on the standard basis.\" 25 As to the other applications, the Court of Appeal said (at paragraph 11) \"In our judgment, the conduct of the Applicant both in relation to the adjournment application and the last minute applications for fresh evidence was unreasonable and justifies an aw ard of indemnity costs.\" c. Extension of Dr Cochrane's bankruptcy 26 On 14 January 2021, the Royal Court granted an application by the Viscount to extend Dr Cochrane's bankruptcy for three years (to 24 November 2023), for the reasons set out in a judgment dated 29 January 2021 (pages 925-930). The Royal Court noted that: \"3. The Viscount has taken control or possession of certain realisable assets of Dr Cochrane valued at approximately \u00a375,000 and believes that Dr Cochrane also owns further realisable assets, including an interest in certain Jersey properties and movable p roperty located therein, and shares in various other A1.5/80 65 companies. However, the ownership of such further assets of Dr Cochrane is currently the subject of proceedings in the High Court of England and Wales (CL -2017-000323) (\u201cthe English Proceedings\u201d). The English proceedings are highly complex, involving 47 parties and numerous personal and proprietary claims. They are summarised in the judgment of the Court in Viscount v Smith [2020] JRC 043. \u2026 7. The claims filed by potential creditors in Dr Cochrane\u2019s d\u00e9sastre total \u00a3305,261,798.37. Due to the ongoing English Proceedings, the Viscount has not yet conducted an inspection of the creditors\u2019 claims, nor has she formally adjudicated or admitted any of them. The Viscount considers that there is no utility in adjudicating any of the creditors\u2019 claims until the present uncertainty is resolved as to whether, and to what extent, there may be any assets available for distribution in the d\u00e9sastre. In her view, it is also unfair to put the creditors to the cost of proving their claims in circumstances where the English Proceedings are likely to result in the effective adjudication of many of their claims, and there are presently no assets available for distribution.\" d. Further application for a (retrospective) application for an extension of time to appeal 27 On 16 August 2023, Dr Cochrane sent an application",

Further application for a (retrospective) application for an extension of time to appeal 27 On 16 August 2023, Dr Cochrane sent an application to the Jersey Court of Appeal seeking an extension of time to appeal against the declarations en d\u00e9sastre of both Dr Cochrane and Orb on the basis that the PACCAR Decision rendered the Harbour IA unlawful and unenforceable (pages 931-933). On 18 August 2023, Harbour confirmed that it intended to oppose this very late, retrospective application for an extension of time (page 934). 28 As far as we are aware, no directions have been given by the Court of Appeal for the resolution of this application, if indeed it is still being pursued by Dr Cochrane. e. Further application for an extension of the bankruptcy 29 On 3 October 2023, the Viscount issued an application for the further extension of Dr Cochrane's bankruptcy for a further three years (to 24 November 2027) (pages 935-964), resulting in an order of the Jersey Court dated 6 October 2023, convening a substantive hearing ( pages 96 5-969). 30 However, on 27 October 2023, the Viscount and Dr Cochrane agreed to the terms of a consent order that the hearing of that extension application be adjourned until after the determination of any recall application issued by Dr Cochrane (pages 970-971). A1.5/81 66 31 I understand from Harbour\u2019s Jersey lawyer, Advocate Edward Drummond, that irrespective of the outcome of the Viscount's application to extend the bankruptcy of Dr Cochrane, Orb will remain in bankruptcy; the provisions of Articles 39 to 42 of the Bankruptcy ( D\u00e9sastre ) (Jersey) Law 1990 only apply to individuals and do not apply to companies. f. Recall Application 32 On 21 November 2023, Dr Cochrane issued a representation seeking the recall of the declarations en d\u00e9sastre made in respect of her estate and the estate of Orb pursuant to Article 7 of the D\u00e9sastre (Bankruptcy) (Jersey) Law 1990 on the basis that they are both currently balance sheet solvent, with very small (or zero) claims against them, but with assets valued in the tens of millions of pounds. I understand from Harbour\u2019s Jersey lawyers, Bedell Cristin, that a recall petition such as this is adjudicated on the basis of the petitioner\u2019s balance sheet solvency as at the date of the application. Harbour\u2019s position is that Dr Cochrane has misrepresented both the nature of the assets which the Court should take into account (most of which belong to Orb, or were subject to the LCL Settlement I refer to above) as well the value of those assets, which she has grossly inflated. Additionally, Harbour contends that Dr Cochrane has also misrepre sented the liability position insofar as the claims of Harbour and other creditors are concerned. 33 On 1 December 2023, the representation was adjourned to a convening hearing on 6 February 202 4. On that date, for the reasons given in a judgment of the Royal Court dated 23 February 2024 (pages 972-976), the Viscount was convened to the application. Dr Cochrane was given leave to file an Amended Representation (which she did, dated 7 February 2024 (pages 977-991) and she also filed a further affidavit in support (her Third Affidavit sworn on 11 March 2024), which was served on creditors (pages 34 8 \u2013",
