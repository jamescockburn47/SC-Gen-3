FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF TAMAR HALEVY  
_____________________________________________________________  A1.6/99
 
 
 
 2  
I, Tamar Halevy,  of 80 Cheapside, London EC2V 6EE , WILL STATE as follows:  
A. INTRODUCTION  
1. I am a Partner in the law firm Marriott Harrison LLP (“MH”) of the above address . MH 
acts for  Mr Nicholas Thomas  in relation to the applications referred to in paragraph 2 
below . 
2. I make this witness statement : 
2.1. In response to an application dated 31 October 2024 by Harbour Fund II, LP 
(“Harbour ”) (the “ Harbour Application ”) and the 20th witness statement of 
Mr Adam Zoubir dated 31 October 2024 (“ Zoubir 20 ”) filed and served in 
support of it; and  
2.2. In support of Mr Thomas’  cross -application  (the “ Thomas Cross-
Application ”). The Harbour Application and the Thomas Cross -Application  
each seek mirror image  declaratory and consequential  relief relating to  the 
enforceability of key parts of the Harbour Investment Agreement dated 10 July 
2013 (the “ Harbour IA ”) in the wake of  the decision of the Supreme Court in 
R (on the application of PACCAR Inc & Ors) v Competition Appeal Tribunal & 
Ors [2023] UKSC 28 (“ PACCAR ”) (together,  the “Enforceability 
Applications ”). 
3. Specifically : 
3.1. By the Harbour Application, Harbour seeks “directions, declarations and other  
relief ” in the terms of a draft order filed and served by Harbour with the Harbour 
Application , the principal e ffect of which (if granted) would be that Harbour 
could  rely on and enforce  all of  the rights  and interests  purportedly granted to it  
under the Harbour IA  and Mr Thomas would be prevented from challenging the 
same . A1.6/100
 
 
 
 3 3.2. The Thomas Cross -Application  seeks , essentially , the reverse relief, most 
notably a declaration  or declarations to the effect that  key parts of  the Harbour 
IA is /are not enforceable by Harbour  against the funded parties thereunder, 
including Mr Thomas, together with  any consequential relief  as may be  
appropriate , principally in the terms of  the draft order provided  with the 
accompanying a pplication notice .  The Thomas Cross -Application is made 
pursuant to paragraph 27 of the Order of Mr Justice Foxton dated 11 June 2021 
(the “ Consequentials Order ”) (page 12 ). 
4. I am duly authorised by Mr Thomas  to make this witness statement  in opposition to the 
Harbour Application  and in support of  the Thomas Cross -Application . In both respects, 
and as necessary, this witness statement respond to matters set out in Zoubir 20 . 
However, for  the avoidance of doubt, this statement does not engage in a line -by-line 
response to Zoubir 20.  Where I do not expressly deal with a point raised in Zoubir 20, 
Mr Thomas should not thereby be taken to have admitted  that point . 
5. Both Mr Thomas  and Harbour are existing parties to these proceedings.  My firm does 
not presently  act for any other party.  
6. The facts and matters set out in this statement are within my own knowledge, unless the 
contrary is expressly stated.  Where they are within my own knowledge they are true to 
the best of my knowledge and belief.  Where the facts and matters are not within my own 
knowledge, I give the source of my information and believe them to be true.  
7. I refer to a paginated bundle of documents marked “Exhibit TH1”.  It contains copies of 
the documents to which I refer in this statement.  Unless the context makes otherwise 
clear, references to page numbers in this statement are to “Exhibit T H1”.  
8. I deal with the following topics  in this witness statement : 
8.1. First, I summarise Mr Thomas’ position on the Enforceability Applica tions, 
together with some high-level observations in relation to the contents of this 
witne ss statement  and Zoubir 20  (Section B); A1.6/101
 
 
 
 4 8.2. Second, I set out t he essential background to the Enforceability Application s 
(Section  C); 
8.3. Third, I set out t he key terms of the Harbour IA  insofar as they are relevant to 
the Enforceability Application s (in particular, the Thomas Cross -Application) 
(Section D); 
8.4. Fourth, I explain t he correspondence between MH (on Mr Thomas’ behalf) and 
Harcus Parker LLP (“Harcus Parker ”) (on behalf of Harbour ) about the 
enforceability of the Harbour IA , the culmination of which is a dispute  about the 
enforceability of key aspects of  the Harbour IA which now takes expression in 
the form of the issued Enforceability Applications (Section  E); 
8.5. Fifth, I address t he grounds on which Mr Thomas contends  that key parts of the 
Harbour IA is/are unenforceable by Harbour  (Section F), and why  Harbour’s  
severance  argument s addressed (to some extent) in Zoubir 20 and its pre -action 
correspondence with my firm  are wrong  (Section G); 
8.6. Sixth, I set out Mr Thomas’ position in relation to Harbour’s additional 
arguments , disconnected from the merits of Mr Thomas’ application, that: (i)  
the Thomas Cross -Application and Mr Thomas’ resistance to the Harbour 
Application should  each be dismissed in toto  as an abuse of the Court’s process  
and/or by the application of a form of  “estoppel ”, and/or (ii) the Thomas Cross -
Application (but, by contrast , and somehow,  not the reverse  application which 
Harbour has made ) is time -barred pursuant to the Limitation Act 1980  (Sectio n 
H); and 
8.7. Lastly, I summarise t he form of declaration(s)/order(s) the parties invite  the 
Court to make on the  Enforceability Applications  (Section I). 
9. In doing so, I do not rehearse in full or seek to limit the detailed legal submissions which 
Mr Thomas will make in due course about these  or other  matters  arising for determination 
by the Court  in relation to the Enforceability Applications .  A1.6/102
 
 
 
 5 B. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  AND SCOPE OF THIS STATEMENT  
(1) Mr Thomas’ position in summary  
10. Notwithstanding various attempts by Harbour in Zoubir 20 to complicate the m by 
reference to  tangential or purely prejudicial  issues,  the Enforceability Applications relate , 
at their core,  to narrow  and technical  questions of law  relating to the enforceability of the 
Harbour IA . Mr Thomas ’ position on those issues, and the other issues raised in Zoubir 
20, is set out in summary form in this section . 
11. It is clear  (and agreed by Harbour)  that at least part of the Harbour IA  is a damages -based 
agreement (“ DBA ”) for the purposes of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (the 
“CLSA 1990 ”) and, therefore,  the DBA  has to comply with certain provisions of the 
CLSA 1990 and the Damages Based Regulations (SI 2013/609)  (the “DBA Regs  2013 ”). 
In particular, Harbour admits that the Harbour IA  (or the relevant part of it) meets the 
first two criteria for a DBA under the CLSA 1990 (Zoubir 20, §§75 -76).  Although 
Harbour  does not expressly  accept that the Harbour IA  meets the third criterion , §80 of 
Zoubir 20 confirms that Harbour does not contend that the Harbour I A (or the relevant 
part of it)  meets the regulatory requirements for DBAs . 
12. Zoubir 20 does not address the other breaches identified  by Mr Thomas in pre -action 
correspondence. However, it is clear that the DBA  in this case  is roundly non -compliant 
with the requirements of the CLSA 1990 and/or the DBA Regs 2013 for the reasons 
explained below . 
13. It is common ground that, to the extent the Harbour IA is a DBA and is non -compliant 
with the relevant legislation,  that DBA  is not enforceable by Harbour  unless Harbour can 
sever the  offending  provisions.  For the reasons set out below, Mr Thomas’ position  is 
that Harbour’s severance arguments are wrong  and, as a result, the DBA part of the 
Harbour IA  is unenforceable by Harbour against “ the Claimants ”. 
14. If the Thomas Cross -Application succeeds, Mr Thomas seeks the relief set out in  the draft 
order provided in support of it, notably:  A1.6/103
 
 
 
 6 14.1. Declaratory relief as to the  non-enforceability of key parts  of the Harbour IA . 
14.2. Consequential declaratory relief concerning  Harbour’s (non -)interest in any part 
of the Proceeds (as defined in the Harbour IA)  and/or any payment under or in 
relation to the Harbour IA . 
14.3. Any v ariations to  the Consequentials Order  to give effect to the foregoing 
matters  as may be  appropriate ; and  
14.4. Any other relief the Court thinks fit.  
(2) Harbour’s other arguments , satellite issues, and purported reservations of 
rights  
15. Harbour  raise s a plethora of points  in Zoubir 20  which  have nothing to do with the legal 
issues highlighted above  and are an attempt by Harbour either t o prevent the Court from  
determining the enforceability question put before it  – including by Harbour on its own 
application – or to delay Mr Thomas’ access to the Court in having  the Enforceability 
Applications  determined  and vindicating his substantive rights.  
16. These other points  fall broadly into three  categories . First, Harbour relies on various  legal  
arguments  as to why  Mr Thomas  is allegedly  not entitled to challenge the enforceability  
of the  Harbour IA on the grounds of  (i) accusations of  abuse of process ; (ii) “estoppel  or 
similar principles ”, including estoppel by deed ; and (iii) vague  limitatio n arguments .  
17. Second, Harbour relies on  or raises  a series of procedural  reasons for  debarring or 
delaying  Mr Thomas  from defending the Harbour Application and  proceeding with the 
Thomas Cross -Application . These include : 
17.1. Reliance on  the so -called ‘Debarring/Directions Order’  of Mr Justice Foxton 
referred to in  Zoubir  20 at §15-21, which Mr Zoubir suggests  may even be 
relevant to “ the relief sought by Mr Thomas ” (and , in Zoubir  20 at §31, purports 
to reserve Harbour’s  rights) .  He does not explain what relevance this is alleged 
to have  to the relief Mr Thomas seeks  or why it is appropriate merely for A1.6/104
 
 
 
 7 Harbour to reserve any rights  it has in this regard .  
17.2. A procedural point concerning out of time appeal s (Zoubir 20, §24).  I note that  
Mr Zoubir  stops short of positively  contending that  this Court is not capable of 
determining the issues on the Enforceability Applications . This appears to be a 
further attempt to preserve an argument for later in the event that Harbour’s 
arguments of principle fail.  
17.3. Harbour’s proposed approach to case management (not previously made known 
to Mr Thomas) , including a n unnecessary  two-staged approach to the issues, 
without providing an y good  reason why dividing the issues between the parties 
would be proportionate or efficient in this case (Zoubir 20, §§22 -23).   
18. Third , Mr Zoubir purports to reserve Harbour’s right to raise  further arguments  at some 
unspecified point in the future .  Mr Zoubir gives some “ examples ” at §147 of Zoubir 20:  
“These include, for example:  (a) [...] whether Harbour can hold  Dr Cochrane , Mr 
Thomas  and Mr Taylor liable for breach of the representations and warranties at Cl 
3.1(g) of the Harbour IA under which they promised that the obligations assumed were 
“legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations” in the amount of any reduction to 
Harbour’s entitlement; (b) whether Harbour can nevertheless uphold its rights on 
alternative bases, such as proprietary estoppel, constructive or resulting trusts, unjust 
enrichment or equitable allowance, or the survival of the Harbour Trust even in the 
event that the Harbour I A is found to be unenforceable  in whole or in part; and (c) the 
impact of any of these determinations on the position of other parties to the proceedings .” 
(emphasis added)  
19. No explanation is given  by Mr Zoubir  for why this approach would be  appropriate, 
proportionate, and consistent with  the overriding objective  and the principle of finality .     
20. Mr Thomas ’ position is that  it is not appropriate for  Harbour, via Zoubir 20  or at all , to 
raise grounds on which it wishes  to pursue the Harbour Application  and/or defend the 
Thomas Cross -Application  that are not properly  explain ed (now).  For example:  
20.1. Harbour ’s argument that Mr Thomas is “barred by doctrines of estoppel or 
similar principles ” from vindicating his rights , appears to be an attempt  to open 
up an issue or issues but  (i) not to explain  which forms of estoppel are relied A1.6/105
 
 
 
 8 upon  (beyond estoppel by deed ) and the legal and factual bases for applying 
them to the Enforceability Applications , and (ii) to widen Harbour’s potential 
argument even further by reference to principles “ similar ” to estoppel (whatever 
that is intended to mean). I  also note that MH sought clarification  about this pre-
action correspondence but Harbour has failed to provide this : for example, see 
MH’s letter of  23 August 2024 (§§5 -8) (pages 809 -811); Harcus Parker’s 
response dated 9 September 2024 (§3)  (page 817 ); MH’s further letter dated  25 
September 2024 (§§ 5-7) (page 822 ); and Harcus Parker’s response  dated 9 
October 2024 (§§2 -3) (page 829 ).   
20.2. Harbour now raises two possible limitation argument s (a six -year period or 
alternatively laches)  but has failed  to articulate how they are said to apply in this 
case.  
20.3. Harbour confirms that it accepts  (as indeed it must) the Supreme Court’s 
decision in PACCAR .  It also concedes, as above, the application of the  first limb 
of the test in  s.58AA(3) of the  CLSA 1990  (Zoubir 20, §75) .  However, it also 
purports to reserve its right to challenge “any other point  [which]  ultimately had 
to be determined by the Supreme Court ” (Zoubir 20, §75)  (by which Mr Zoubir 
presumably means in relation to the first limb of the CLSA 1990 test).1  Mr 
Zoubir  does not explain what is meant by this  and I respectfully suggest it is not 
open to Harbour to decline to take (or indeed explain) points that it intends to 
rely on in relation to the PACCAR  decision . 
21.  I am concerned that the  above  points may be developed as late as the provision of a 
skeleton argument shortly before  the substantive hearing of the Enforceability 
Applications , when Mr Thomas will not have a fair opportunity to respond to them .  
Again, I believe, respectfully,  that, unless and to the extent the above arguments are 
explained properly  in its respons ive evidence , Harbour  should not be allowed  to rely on 
them at the hearing of the Enforceability Applications .  
 
1 Harbour takes a similar approach to the Blue Pencil Test (as defined in Zoubir 20 at §122.1) : see fn.23  of Zoubir 
20.  A1.6/106
 
 
 
 9 (3) Other m atters not covered in this statement  
22. For completeness,  I also wish to highlight that large parts of Zoubir 20 are not relevant 
to the  substance of the  Enforceability A pplications . Where that is the case, and without 
admission, I do not respond to the m in the interests of brevity and relevance.  
23. These  issues include (but are not necessarily limited to):  
23.1. Mr Zoubir’s account of events after  the Directed Trial  for example, but without 
limitation, Section D  (§§49-51 of Zoubir 20 );  
23.2. Alleged events  and arguments  concerni ng parties other than Mr Thomas : e.g., 
Section s E and L , and Section G  (insofar as it is concerned with the so -called 
‘LCL Settlement’ ) of Zoubir 20 ;  
23.3. Purely case management issues  (e.g. Zoubir 20 at §§ 22-23);  
23.4. Matters concerning the so -called ‘Debarring/Directions Order’  (e.g. Zoubir 20 
at §15 and §§17 -21); and  
23.5. Other seemingly irrelevant issues, such as Harbour’s alleged “ reliance ” on the 
Harbour IA ( e.g. Zoubir 20, Section J) .  
24. I also note that  attempts have been made in Zoubir 20  to elide the actions of Dr Smith 
and/or Cochrane with that of Mr Thomas  (for example in the entirety of Section D of 
Zoubir 20 ), by use of  the defined term , “the Smith Parties ” throughout .  This is an 
unhelpful, tendentious , and potentially misleading  use of definitional language . Mr 
Thomas’ position is  explained in  some  more detail in his  witness statement  filed in 
connection with the Enforceability Applications .  
25. Finally, I note §§24-31 of Zoubir 20 concerning the possibility of an appeal from the 
Directed Trial Judgment. Mr Thomas’ position is that this Court can give the necessary 
relief sought in the Thomas Cross -Application, and indeed (although it is resisted) on the 
Harbour Application  under the liberty to apply provision  at §27 of the Consequentials A1.6/107
 
 
 
 10 Order  as explained below  (page 12 ).  Harbour appears at least to agree with the latter 
proposition  (that the Court can give relief on the Harbour Application) , and I respectfully 
suggest it applies to both Enforceability Applications.  
C. ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND  
26. The underlying background to th e Original Proceedings  (defined below)  in relation to 
which the Harbour IA was entered into  is so substantial  and peripheral to the 
enforceability issue  that I do not consider it  practicable  or proportionate  to rehearse  all 
of it here . Zoubir 20 adopts the same approach.   Therefore,  I have set out below  only the 
key factual and procedural background  to the Enforceability Applications . 
(1) The Original Proceedings and Harbour IA2 
The underlying dispute  
27. The original  litigation against  a Mr Andrew  Ruhan  (“Mr Ruhan ”) (claim number CL -
2012 -00625) concerned claims to recover funds from Mr Ruhan in connection with an 
alleged property -related profit -sharing agreement (the “ Original Proceedings ”). 
28. The genesis of the dispute in the Original Proceedings was the dealings between two 
businessmen, Dr Gerald Smith (“ Dr Smith ”) and Mr Ruhan.  Dr Smith had previously 
been convicted of theft from a company pension fund and served two years’ 
imprisonment, and was later convicted of theft of a further (approximately) £35 million 
from Izodia PLC (“ Izodia ”) (the “ Izodia Theft ”) for which he served a further  eight 
years in prison.3  
29. Orb A.R.L (“ Orb”) was the First Claimant in the Original Proceedings . Mr Roger Taylor 
and Mr Thomas were  the other Claimant s (together, the “ Orb Claimants ”). At the time 
of the Original Proceedings, the shares in Orb were held by a company as trustee of a 
 
2 Save where specified below, I take the information underpinning this summary from the Judgment of Mr Justice 
Popplewell (as he then was) in the Original Proceedings under neutral citation [2016] EWHC 850 (Comm) (the 
“2016 Judgment ”) (pages 22 -59) or the  Directed Trial  Judgment of Mr Justice Foxton  (as defined below) in these 
proceedings (pages 60 -279). 
3 DTJ (defined below) , §2 (page 69 ). A1.6/108
 
 
 
 11 Jersey settlement, of which Dr Gail Cochrane (“ Dr Cochrane ”), the former wife of Dr 
Smith, and their two daughters, were  the sole beneficiaries . 
30. Dr Smith committed the Izodia Theft between August and November 2002  while he was 
Orb’s CEO. Of the c.£35m stolen, around £2.8m was returned , leaving c.£32.2m due to 
Izodia.4 In the end, the Serious Fraud Office (“ SFO ”) obtained a Confiscation Order  
against Dr Smith in the sum of approximately £41m .  
31. During the early part of 2003, negotiations took place between Dr Smith on the one hand, 
and Mr Ruhan and a Mr Campbell on the other hand, resulting in an agreement for the 
sale of various of Orb’s assets to Mr Ruhan and companies associated with and/or 
controlled by him  (the “ Orb Assets ”). The nature of the Orb Assets is set out in para graph 
9 of the 2016 Judgment (page 24 ). 
32. Mr Thomas and others alleged in the Original Proceedings that there was a further, oral 
agreement reached at a meeting between Dr Smith, Mr Taylor, Mr Ruhan and Mr 
Campbell on 6 May 2003, pursuant to which the Orb Parties  (being the Claimants in the 
2012 Proceedings plus Dr Cochrane and SMA Investment Holdings Limited (“ SMA ”)) 
alleged that it was agreed ( inter alia ) that Mr Ruhan would redevelop, restructure, 
manage and/or dispose of various of the Orb Assets , and  he would pay Orb, Mr Taylor 
and Mr Thoma s, in agreed proportions , certain percentages of the profits of various of 
the Orb Assets.  Mr Ruhan denie d any such oral agreement.  
33. Thereafter, the Orb Assets were transferred by Mr Ruhan into a complex structure 
involving various companies ultimately owned by the trustee of an Isle of Man settlement 
(the “ Arena Settlement ”). There were over 100 companies within the Are na Settlement .  
34. Mr Justice Popplewell explained the structure of the Arena Settlement in the following 
terms at [20] -[25] of his 2016 Judgment:  
34.1. The trustee held the assets through its 100% shareholding in each of six holding 
companies. It was the shares in these six holding companies which were 
 
4 2016 Judgment, §8  (page 23 ). A1.6/109
 
 
 
 12 transferred to SMA under the IOM Settlement (explained below) . Four of those 
holding companies were Glen Moar Properties Ltd (“ Glen Moar ”), Sulby 
Investment Holdings Ltd (“ Sulby ”), Ballaugh Holdings Ltd (“ Ballaugh ”) and 
Unicorn Worldwide Holdings Ltd (“ Unicorn ”); 
34.2. Those holding companies in turn were parent companies of groups of other 
companies (see [22] -[24] of the 2016 Judgment);  and 
34.3. Glen Moar, Sulby, Ballaugh, and Unicorn were incorporated in the British 
Virgin Islands and in March 2015 were each put into liquidation. The appointed 
liquidators were partners of Quantuma LLP  (“Quantuma ”). 
35. Mr Ruhan  (eventually)  admitted5 that he was at all material times the ultimate beneficiary 
of the Arena Settlement  by virtue of his former solicitors and advis ers, Mr Simon Cooper 
and Mr Simon McNally, who held the interest  as nominee for him. Mr Ruhan  also 
contended  that he was in ultimate control of all of the companies within the Arena 
Settlement.  
36. On 27 October 2012, shortly after Dr Smith’s release from prison in connection with the 
Izodia The ft, the Original Proceedings were commenced by the Orb Claimants . In 
essence, they alleged that , in breach of the oral agreement reached in May 2003 and Mr 
Ruhan’s fiduciary duties, Mr Ruhan had (i) sought to conceal the Orb Assets in the 
complex structure of the Arena Settlement, (ii) sold them for his own benefit, and (iii) 
failed to account for the share of the profits due under the oral agreement .  
The funding position  
37. The Harbour IA was entered into on 10 July 2013 between Harbour  and the Orb 
Claimants. A copy of the Harbour IA is at pages  280-374. 
38. The purpose of the Harbour IA was for Harbour to provide litigation funding to the Orb 
Claimants to fund  the Original Proceedings against Mr Ruhan, involving t he causes of 
 
5 Formally in the Original Proceedings.  A1.6/110
 
 
 
 13 action referred to in Schedule 1 of the Harbour IA (page 305 ), defined as:  
“Each and every claim that the Claimants may seek to assert against the Defendant or any 
other person, arising out of or related to an agreement concluded on 6 May 2003 between 
the Claimants and the Defendant, whereby the Defendant agreed to pay or procure to be 
paid to the Claimants an agreed percentage of any profits accruing to the Defendant 
directly or indirectly from the future sale of certain real property whic h the First Claimant 
had transferred to the Defendant on or about the same date and includes any and all 
statutory, legal or equitable cause or causes of action, whether to be made in [England 
and Wales] or in any other jurisdiction that are or may be vest ed in the Claimants or its 
Affiliates against the Defendant or any other person, arising out of or related to the said 
agreement .”  
39. Harbour agreed under the Harbour IA to provide the Orb Claimants funding of c. £5.28 
million to meet their legal costs in the Original Proceedings: see the Directed Trial 
Judgment (defined below) at §71 (page 88 ). I note Mr Zoubir gives a figure of 
£5,189,010.48 at para. 10 of his Affidavit dated 18 June 2024 (page 377 ) in respect of 
sums actually advanced.  
40. As set out in more detail below, the Harbour IA provided for Harbour to receive ( inter 
alia) a percentage of the value of the Proceeds (as defined in the Harbour IA and below) 
of the Original Proceedings, including from any settlement of those proceedings, and (as  
also explained in more detail below) created (under Clause 8) the Harbour Trust (defined 
below and in the Harbour IA) under which the Orb Claimants were to hold all Proceeds.  
The IOM Settlement  
41. During the Original Proceedings , in March 2014, Dr Cochrane and SMA  (a company 
incorporated in the Marshall Islands which she owned  and controlled ) entered into the 
so-termed ‘Isle of Man Settlement’ with Mr Cooper and Mr McNally  (the “ IOM 
Settlement ”), including the signing of the IOM Confidential Deed on 24 March 2014 .  
42. As Popplewell J (as he then was) found,6 the effect of the IOM Settlement  was for Mr 
Cooper and Mr McNally to procure the transfer by the trustee of the Arena Settlement 
(AS Managers Ltd ) to Dr Smith, Dr Cochrane, SMA and/or their nominees, ownership 
and control of all of the businesses and property which they held under the terms of the 
 
6 At [16]  (page 25 ). See also the Directed Trial Judgment at [81]  (page 91 ). A1.6/111
 
 
 
 14 Arena Settlement (the “Arena Assets ”), together with other shareholdings in companies 
which were outside the Arena Settlement (the “Non-Arena Assets ”). 
43. In response  to the IOM Settlement , Mr Ruhan  alleged (and counterclaimed in the Original 
Proceedings for)  the misappropriation of both the Arena and Non -Arena Assets , arguing  
that those assets were in reality his  and tha t Mr Cooper and Mr McNally were always his 
nominees.  Mr Ruhan advanced a proprietary claim to the assets and their traceable 
proceeds which were acquired by the Orb Parties from Messrs McNally and Cooper, both 
those from the Arena Settlement and the Non -Arena Assets, together with personal 
claims in constructive trust and conspiracy to defraud .7 
44. Mr Justice Foxton found, in relation to  the IOM Settlement, in his judgment dated 18 
May 2021 in these proceedings (neutral citation [2021] EWHC 1272 (Comm)) (the 
“Directed Trial ” and “ Directed Trial Judgment ” or “ DTJ ”) at [190] -[192]  as follows : 
“190. On its face, the IOM Settlement involved the transfer: i) by ASML of the Arena Companies; 
ii) by Messrs Cooper and McNally of the Cooper and McNally Companies; and iii) of cash held 
by the Arena Companies and Messrs Cooper and McNally; to Dr Cochrane and SMA.  
191. On the transferee side, I am satisfied that Dr Cochrane and SMA were acting on behalf of 
the Orb Claimants, and that any assets which they received were received as nominees, on bare 
trust for the Orb Claimants...  
[...] 
192. On the transferor side, I have already set out my reasons for concluding that any interest 
that Messrs Cooper and McNally had in the Transferred Assets was held as nominee for Mr 
Ruhan. ” (pages 121 -122). 
45. In October 2014, Harbour, the Orb Claimants, Dr Cochrane, Messrs Cooper and McNally 
and Stewarts Law LLP (“ Stewarts ”) entered into a deed (the “ 2014 Harbour Deed ”) 
(pages 392 -395).  The 2014 Harbour Deed provided that, for the purpose of Clause 9.1 
of the Harbour IA (the ‘Waterfall ’ referred to  and defined  below), the Settlement 
Consideration paid to or for the benefit of Dr Cochrane under the IOM MSA would be 
treated as “ proceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings ”, and, therefore, 
 
7 2016 Judgment at [17] -[18] (page 25 ). A1.6/112
 
 
 
 15 as part of the Proceeds (page 393 ) (DTJ, §87 ( page 93 )). 
46. Of the assets placed within the control of the Orb Claimants by the IOM Settlement, Mr 
Justice Foxton found that a number were liquidated and their proceeds used to acquire 
various other assets (only some of which were at issue in the Directed Trial, as will be 
seen below: see §88 of the DTJ) (page 93 ). 
47. Further events (not sufficiently germane to the Enforceability Applications  to be set out 
in detail herein) in the Original Proceedings are set out in [89] -[103] of the DTJ (pages 
94-97). 
The Geneva Settlement  
48. In or around April 2016, various settlement agreements were executed in Geneva 
(collectively, the  “Geneva Settlement ”) (DTJ, [105] (page 98 )). This settled the claims 
of all parties to the Original Proceedings (including Mr Ruhan’s to recover assets 
transferred under the IOM Settlement ( DTJ, [232]) and led to the dismissal of the 
Original Proceedings by consent on 6 May 2016 ( DTJ, [105]) (pages 137 and 98 ). 
49. Mr Justice Foxton noted various features of the constituent elements of the Geneva 
Settlement in the DTJ at [107] (page 98 -99), as follows : 
“The various agreements comprising the Geneva Settlement share the complexity which is 
characteristic of the dealings of those who were parties to them. However, in broad terms:  
i) A document which I will refer to as the “Confidential Settlement Deed” contained general 
releases by 11 parties of all claims relating to the 2012 Proceedings and associated litigation.  
ii) The seven principal individuals who were parties to the 2012 Proceedings entered into another 
document, “the Confidential Deed”, which included covenants not to sue those parties and their 
affiliates (an expression defined in notably wide terms).  
iii) There were two agreements relating to Minardi: “the Minardi SpA” and “the Minardi Deed 
of Release”. The former transferred shares held in Minardi to Phoenix, a company said to be 
owned by Mr Stevens. The latter involved a release by SMA of a £2,500,00 0 loan which it had 
made to Minardi.   
iv) A loan note issued by Dr Cochrane (“the Loan Note”) under which Dr Cochrane agreed to 
pay £73,750,000 to Phoenix by 31 December 2017 (under a structure which incentivised early A1.6/113
 
 
 
 16 interim payments, to avoid an interest rate of 15%, the first instalment falling due on 31 May 
2016 in the sum of £3m). In support of that obligation Dr Cochrane provided a negative pledge 
over certain assets said to be worth £80.2m.  
v) A document entitled the “Liquidation Inter -Creditor Settlement Agreement” (the “LICSA”) 
which was entered into between SMA, Phoenix, Minardi and Dr Cochrane, the terms of which 
are considered in detail at Section K below .” 
50. Subsequent events  (again not sufficiently germane to the Enforceability Applications  to 
be set out in full here)  – including interventions from the National Crime Agency with 
respect to a payment attempted by Dr Cochrane under the Loan Note (forming part of the 
Geneva Settlement, as above ) and freezing orders obtained by multiple  parties – are 
explained in [108] -[116] of the DTJ (pages 99 -100). 
(2) These SFO Proceedings  
51. Following the IOM Settlement, a dispute arose between the SFO and  other parties 
allegedly interested in the assets or reali sable property of Dr Smith  that led to the se 
proceedings  (the “SFO Proceedings ”) in which the Enforceability Application s are now 
brought  (Claim No.  CL-2017 -000323 ).  
52. My understanding of the background to the SFO Proceedings is (briefly)  as follows:  
52.1. They were initially commenced to enable the SFO  to attempt to satisfy a 
confiscation order made against Dr Smith on 13  November 2007  (the 
“Confiscation Order ”) by way of a claim to Dr Smith’s alleged reali sable 
property within the meaning of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 : see §8(i) , §64,  
§§108 -116, and §§597 -599 of the DTJ (pages 71, 87, 99 -100 and 255 ); 
52.2. The assets in relation to which the SFO was seeking to enforce the Confiscation  
Order  were those assets allegedly constituting  Dr Smith’s reali sable property 
but alleged to have been held by the following persons as nominees for Dr Smith 
(with the effect of obscuring that those assets were his reali sable property )8: 
 
8 This is a summary. See DTJ, §593 onwards for a fuller explanation (page 254 ).   A1.6/114
 
 
 
 17 52.2.1.  SMA, in respect of the Transferred Companies;  
52.2.2.  Dr Cochrane, in respect of the Non -Arena Companies, the Jersey 
Properties , and any interest in the so-termed “Identified Underlying 
Assets” (the “ IUAs ”) traceable to funds emanating from Dr 
Cochrane;  
52.2.3.  Litigation Capital Limited (“ LCL ”), in respect of the Non -Arena 
Companies to the extent transferred to them by the LCL Transfers  
(as defined in the DTJ) , the Jersey Properties and Flat 1 Hamilton 
House;  
52.2.4.  Conduit Asset Management Limited (“ Conduit ”), as the legal 
owner of the shares in LCL ; and 
52.2.5.  A Dr Imogen Smith in respect of Flat 1 Hamilton House .  
52.3. At a hearing on 6 March 2017, Popplewell J directed any party claiming an 
interest in the  relevant  assets to file a position paper setting out which assets it 
asserted a claim to, and the basis of that claim : see §§102 -116 of the DTJ (pages 
97-100); 
52.4. 23 parties filed position papers  and, following a further hearing, Popplewell J 
directed the SFO and the Enforcement Receivers ( appointed on the application 
of the SFO: see DTJ, §8(i)  (page 71 )), if so advised , to issue an application 
seeking a determination of the extent to which (what became) the Transferred 
and Non -Arena Companies and the Jersey Properties (each of which are defined 
in paragraph 53 below)  (together, the “ Relevant Property ”) constituted the 
realisable property of Dr Smith for the purpose of  enforcement  of the 
Confiscation Order  (DTJ, §117 ) (page 101 ); 
52.5. On or around 24 or 25 April 2018, Popplewell J  (amongst other things and per 
§121 of the DTJ) (page 102 ) joined various parties as respondents to the SFO 
Proceedings;  and directed the Directed Trial would take place to determine the A1.6/115
 
 
 
 18 ownership of the Relevant Property ; and 
52.6. The Court noted that, of the various parties asserting claims, Harbour, Stewarts, 
and Messrs Thomas and Taylor asserted their alleged entitlements arising from 
their involvement in the Original Proceedings on the side (at that time) of Dr 
Smith  (DTJ, §156(iii)) (page 112 ), whilst the SFO asserted its entitlements in 
respect of any reali sable property  of Dr Smith to the extent that it had not been 
found to be  subject to the proprietary rights of other parties  (DTJ, §593) (page 
254). 
53. In the event, the Directed Trial considered and determined the various claims to the 
Relevant Property , which fell  into five categories:  
53.1. The “Transferred Assets ”, comprising (i) the “ IOM Settleme nt Cash ”9 and 
(ii) “Transferred Companies ”10;  
53.2. Shares in the “ Non-Arena Companies ”, being shares in 27 Marshall Islands, 
Manx, Canadian, Dutch, Jersey and English companies which Mr Justice Foxton 
recorded were “ created by entities alleged to be associated with Dr Smith ” 
(DTJ, §1); 
53.3. Four properties in Jersey  (the “ Jersey Properties ”) (DTJ, §1; Section P3) 
(pages 69; 227 -240); 
53.4. The IUAs comprising various properties, the proceeds of properties, the benefit 
of a loan and jewellery which  Mr Justice Foxton noted were  identified in 
Schedule 2 to his Order of 20  May 202 0 (DTJ, §1; Section U) (pages 69; 271 -
279); and  
53.5. The sum of £2 million paid into the accounts of Stewarts on 14 September 2016  
 
9 Defined as being the cash paid pursuant to the IOM Settlement – the initial £10m, a further £583,321.80 , and a 
payment made at Messrs Cooper and McNally’s direction of £2.5m : DTJ, §422(iv) (pages 197 ). 
10 Defined as the shares in 18 BVI and Manx companies transferred into the ownership of SMA Investment 
Holdings Ltd (“SMA”) shortly after  the IOM Settlement wa s reached : DTJ, §1 (pages 69 ). A1.6/116
 
 
 
 19 (DTJ, §1; Section O) (pages 69; 220 -223). 
54. On 28 May 2021, Mr Justice Foxton handed down the DTJ on the ownership of the 
Relevant Property.  The DTJ is wide -ranging and considers a vast number of issues which 
I do not attempt to s et these out in full here.  Relevantly, however, the Court will note 
that Section H of the DTJ dealt  with ‘ISSUES ARISING IN RELATION TO THE 
HARBOUR IA’ (pages 114 -121) and made findings  about the assets that fell within the  
Harbour Trust, including whether they included assets transferred to Dr Cochrane or 
SMA under the IOM and/or Geneva Settlements ( DTJ, §§167 -181).  
55. Whilst Mr Justice Foxton construed  some of the terms of the Harbour IA for the above 
purposes  and conclude d that the IOM and Geneva Settlements each constituted ‘Success 
in the Proceedings’ for the purposes of the Harbour IA  (DTJ, §§165 -166) (pages 114 -
115), his Judgment did n ot (because he was not required or requested to)  engage with the 
matters raised in these Enforceability Applications ; principally , whether certain parts of 
the Harbour IA were  unenforceable  in light of the CLSA 1990/DBA Regs 2013 .  
56. I am also instructed that the beneficial ownership of the Non -Arena Assets has not yet 
been determined .  I note that Mr Zoubir claims that this is “ not... fully accurate ” (in 
relation to a position apparently a dvanced by Dr Cochrane in the Jersey Proceedings) in 
that “the IUAs (which the Directed Trial did determine ownership of) were owned by 
various Non -Arena Companies ” (Zoubir 20, §70). This is addressed in Mr Thomas’ 
statement in relation to the Enforceability Applications.  
(3) The Consequentials  Order and Proceed s 
The Consequentials Order  
57. On 11 June 2021 Mr Justice Foxton made the Consequentials Order giving effect to his 
findings in the DTJ (pages 2 -21). Paragraph s 4 and 5 of th e Consequentials  Order 
identified assets from the Relevant Property that fell within the Harbour Trust and how 
the interests of the Orb Claimants in them were to be apportioned inter se  as follows:   
“Harbour  A1.6/117
 
 
 
 20 4. The interests in the following assets are held by their legal owners on the terms of the Harbour 
Trust and are to be applied and apportioned between the beneficiaries, namely Harbour, Orb 
arl, and Messrs Thomas and Taylor, in accordance with those terms (save as set out below):  
a. The shares in the Arena Companies (as set out in Schedule 2 to this order);  
b. Such future distributions as may be paid or payable to the shareholders of the Arena 
Companies;  
c. The traceable proceeds of the IOM Settlement Cash, but in particular:  
i. An equitable interest of 100% in Flat 24 Hamilton House;  
ii. An equitable interest in 50% of the shares in Bodega;  
iii. An equitable interest of 100% in Flat 2 Hamilton House;  
iv. An equitable interest of 15% in Flat 22 Hamilton House;  
v. An equitable interest of 20.26% in the headlease / leasehold of Hamilton House 
and Flats 1, 10, and 14 Hamilton House (for Flats 10 and 14 Hamilton House, 
taking effect by way of a first ranking charge arising by way of subrogation to 
discharged security);  
vi. An equitable interest of 16.62% in Flats 11, 21 and 23 Hamilton House;  
vii. An equitable interest of 10% in Flat 17 Hamilton House  
d. The traceable proceeds of the £23,921,641.59 paid to Candey LLP which derived from 
the $43.5m Qatar Settlement Payment, but in particular:  
i. An equitable interest of 90% in Flat 12 Hamilton House (reflecting the balance 
of the purchase price);  
ii. An equitable interest of 88.05% in Montagu Square (reflecting the balance of the 
purchase price);  
subject to such claims as remain available to Mr Pelz following the findings in the Trial 
Judgment as set out below at paragraph [23] (for the avoidance of doubt, this qualification 
applies only to the assets listed at items 2.d.i and ii above).  
5. Any share of the proceeds under the Harbour Trust which is attributable to Orb and Messrs 
Thomas and Taylor shall be adjusted as follows:  
a. The entitlement of Orb and Messrs Thomas and Taylor (after payment out of the prior 
items in the waterfall under the Harbour Trust) shall first be determined without any A1.6/118
 
 
 
 21 adjustments, based on the following percentages: 62.5% to Orb, 18.75% to Mr Thomas and 
18.75% to Mr Taylor; [...] ” (pages 6 -7). 
58. With respect to the Non -Arena Companies, paragraph 16 provide d in relation to the SFO 
that, “ With the exception of the shares in Bodega, Dr Gerald Martin Smith holds 100% 
of the equitable interest in the shares of each of the Non Arena Companies (as set out in 
Schedule 2 to this order) ” (pages 17 -19). 
59. Schedule 2 to the Consequentials Order in turn listed the Arena Companies and the Non -
Arena Companies  (page 12 ). 
60. Paragraph 27  of the Consequentials Order  grant ed “liberty to apply ” to those  persons  
subject to  it.  This includes  Mr Thomas  (page 12 ).  I return to any possible impact on the 
Consequentials Order of the relief sought in the Thomas Cross -Application in  Section I 
below.   
The Trust , Receivership, and Share Transfer  Orders  
61. On or around 14 December 2022, Mr Justice Foxton made a further Order (the “ Trust 
Order ”) (pages 396 -400), this time within proceedings CL -2022 -000330  (the 
“Ticehurst Proceedings ”) which ordered ( inter alia ) that:  
61.1. The shares in Glen Moar, Unicorn, Sulby, and two further companies known as 
Legion NA Investments Limited ( formerly Bridge Towers Holdings No I Ltd) 
and Land Consultants Limited , were  declared to be  held by SMA as bare trustee 
for Orb, Mr Thomas and Mr Taylor who in turn hold their respective interests 
jointly as trustees of the Harbour Trust  (§1) (page 398 ); 
61.2. Messrs Thomas and Taylor and Orb were removed as trustees of the Harbour 
Trust with immediate effec t (§5) (page 398 ); 
61.3. New trustees  (Emma Jordan and Tony Graham)  (the so -termed “ New 
Trustees ”) were appointed as trustees of the trusts declared by paragraph 4 of 
the Consequentials Order “insofar as those trusts affect the interests of Orb, Mr 
Thomas and Mr Taylor in the shares in the Relevant Companies  [i.e. those listed A1.6/119
 
 
 
 22 in paragraph 61.1 above]  which SMA holds as nominee for them as trustees of 
the Harbour Trust ...” (§7)  (page 398 ) together with ancillary orders dealing with 
practical issues arising with respect to their dealings with the relevant assets 
(§§9-19) (pages 399 -400). 
62. Likewise , on 14 December 2022, Mr Justice Foxton made an order in connection with 
multiple receivership applications  (the “ Receivership Order ”) (pages 401 -411) in these 
SFO Proceedings .  
63. Pursuant to paragraph 1  of the Receivership Order , David Standish and David Pike of 
Interpath (the “ Joint Receivers ”) were appointed as joint rec eivers of the shares, 
securities  and membership rights , and leasehold properties set out in Schedule 1 to the 
Receivership Order  (pages 410 -411) (together, t he “Receivership Property ”), with the 
rights and powers (etc.) set out in §§ 5-7 of the same (pages 405 -408). 
64. Schedule 1 to the Receivership Order  sets out the assets to which it relates (and is not 
reproduced here) (pages 410 -411).  I have cross -referenced Schedule 1 of the 
Receivership Or der with paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order (set out above) and 
note that : 
64.1. All of the properties listed in paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order appear in 
Schedule 1  of the Receivership Order ; 
64.2. Schedule 1 of the Receivership Order contains other properties not listed in 
paragraph 4  of the Consequentials Order , namel y Flats 3, 18, 19, and 20 of  
Hamilton House, 81 Southampton Row, London, WC1B 4HA  but these 
properties are all listed in Schedule 4 of the Consequentials Order (pages 19 -
21) as being (pursuant to § 20 of the same  (page 10 )) the IUAs11 in which the 
companies under the Joint Liquidators’ control (at that time) had equitable 
interests.  
 
11 This is a reference in turn to paragraph 12 of the Order of Mr Justice Foxton dated 20 May 2020  (pages 423 -
499): see the tenth recital to  the Consequentials Order (page 4 ). A1.6/120
 
 
 
 23 65. On 10 February 2023,  in both these SFO Proceedings and the Ticehurst Proceedings, Mr 
Justice Foxton ordered that SMA must transfer the shares in the Relevant Companies (i.e. 
those set out in paragraph 61.1 above)  to the New Trustees  (§1) (pages 412 -422) (the 
“Share Transfer Order ”).   
‘The Proceeds’  
66. I therefore understand that, as a result of the IOM and Geneva Settlements, very 
substantial assets were recovered and form the ‘Proceeds’ for the purposes of the Harbour 
IA.   
67. Accordingly, and in summary, the Proceeds on which the Harbour IA could bite  include  
(subject to the full terms of the Consequential s Order) : 
67.1. All those assets listed in paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order, being  (in 
summary ): 
67.1.1.  The shares in the Arena Companies set out in Schedule 2  of that 
Order . 
67.1.2.  The future distributions to be paid to shareholders of the Arena 
Companies . 
67.1.3.  The traceable proceeds of the IOM Settlement Cash (as defined) , but 
in particular the equitable interests in particular properties listed in 
§4(c) . 
67.1.4.  The traceable proceeds of the c.£23.9m paid to Candey LLP which 
in turn derived from a $43.5m Qatar Settlement Paym ent (as 
defined) , and in particular the equitable interests in the specific  
properties listed in §4(d) .    
67.2. Shares in the  Non-Arena Companies  which were not transferred under the IOM 
Settlement  (DTJ, §1(ii))  and are  held by the Joint Receivers pursuant to the A1.6/121
 
 
 
 24 Receivership Order (as above) , and in turn the assets of the Non -Arena 
Companies.  
68. It is my understanding that, to date, no assets or funds falling within the Harbour Trust 
have been released to or realised by any of the Orb Claimants or Harbour.  
69. Moreover, I note that there has been and remains a significant dispute about the value of 
the Proceeds.  For example, Harbour asserted in a letter (via its solicitors, Harcus Parker) 
dated 2 July 2021 that the total estimated realisable value of the assets held within the 
Harbour Trust pursuant to the Harbour IA at that time was £23,865,935.70. This is 
disput ed by Mr Thomas . However, it is not necessary for the Court to determine those 
valuation issues as part of the Enforceability Application s. 
(4) The Jersey Proceedings  
70. Harbour is also presently engaged in proceedings (Court reference 2023/35) before the 
Royal Court of  Jersey against Dr Cochrane  (respectively, the “ Jersey Proceedings ” and 
the “Jersey Court ”). Dr Cochrane is, as I understand, the  sole legal owner of the shares 
in Orb .  
Bankruptcy orders  
71. As I understand it (although I do not act for any party to the Jersey Proceedings)  the 
position is  as follows.  
72. On 10 November 2016, Harbour applied for the property of Orb and Dr Cochrane to be 
declared en désastre  and o n 24 November 2016, Harbour obtained bankruptcy  (en 
désastre ) orders against Orb and Dr Cochrane from the Jersey Court, the effect of which 
was to vest the property of Orb and Dr Cochrane in the Viscount  of Jersey  as 
administrator of their estates  (subject to an exception which is not material for present 
purposes) .  
73. It appears from §12 of Mr Adam Zoubir’s Affidavit in the Jersey Proceedings dated 18 
June 2024  (the “Zoubir Jersey Affidavit ”) that the basis for this decision was the Jersey A1.6/122
 
 
 
 25 Court’s finding that Harbour was “ indisputably owed the liquidated sum of 
£5,189,010.48p by Orb and that there was no reasonably arguable defence to that 
claim ”, i.e. it was on the basis of Harbour’s  assumed  entitlements under the Harbour IA . 
Mr Zoubir confirms Harbour’s  relevant assumed  entitlement  as follows  at §13 : 
“The principal figure is based on a  total of Harbour’s investment of nearly £5.2 million, plus a 
calculation of the returns owed under the Funding Agreement, which are triggered by the Orb 
Claimants’ success in the funded proceedings .” (pages 377 -378). 
The Recall and Stay Applications  
74. After the PACCAR  decision was handed down, Dr Cochrane sought to have her ‘désastre’  
set aside or annulled , together with  that of Orb (i.e. the liquidation order made against it)  
(the “ Cochrane Recall  Application ”) (pages 450 -464). 
75. At least part of t he basis of th is application is, as I understand  it, Dr Cochrane’s assertion  
that the Harbour IA is unenforceable as a result of the clarification of the law  on DBAs  
in the PACCAR decision ; and therefore, Orb and Dr Cochrane are not (and never have 
been) indebted to Harbour .   
76. Upon the making of the Cochrane Recall Application, I understand that Harbour applied 
to stay that application (the “ Harbour Stay Application ”).  In the Zoubir Jer sey 
Affidavit  (pages 375 -391), Mr Zoubir told  the Jersey Court , on behalf of Harbour, that: 
76.1. Harbour sought a stay of the Cochrane Set Aside Application on the basis that 
(per §39.1):  
“Harbour now intends to seek a determination from the English Court  as to the status 
of the Directed Trial Judgment including as to the impact if any of the decision in 
PACCAR as well as ancillary matters. If the Jersey court were to deal with these issues, 
which relate to an extraordinarily complex English law dispute with a lengthy history, 
various English Court judgments and the Funding Agreement (which is governed by 
English  law), it would need to hear expert evidence of English law. I would respectfully 
suggest that it would be preferable for any such English law issues to be determined 
by the English court if possible , particularly one that is very familiar with the entire 
background to the matter .” (my emphasis)  (pages 387 ); 
76.2. Harbour further considered that the English Court “ is already seized of this 
matter ” and is familiar with the same (§39.4)  (pages 388 ); and A1.6/123
 
 
 
 26 76.3. “Harbour intends to seek declarations from the English Court in respect of the 
status of the Directed Trial Judgment and related and ancillary matters ” (§39.5) 
(pages 388 -389).   
77. That was told to the Jersey Court in June 2024. In response, Harbour was ordered by the 
Jersey Court to “ file further evidence about the proceedings it intends to bring, including 
a copy of the intended proceedings and any opinion on the merits, the latter for the court 
only, by 5pm on 2 August 2024 ” (pages 465 -466).  In a follow -up affidavit sworn on 2 
August 2024 (pages 467-474), Mr Zoubir provided to the Jersey Court , on behalf of 
Harbour , a draft Application Notice (pages 475 -482) together with a draft witness 
statement of Mr Zoubir (the “ Draft Zoubir Statement ”) (pages 483 -540) and an 
indication that Mr Zoubir “ envisage[d] that Harbour will issue its application [in the 
English Court]  in the early Autumn ” (§23(3)).    
78. As set out above, Harbour  finally  issued its application at the end of October 2024 , 
shortly before the Harbour Stay Application was due to be heard.  
79. I am instructed that the Harbour Stay Application has now been granted . 
80. Save as set out above , I do not explain the Jersey Proceedings in greater detail where this 
is already addressed at some length in Appendix 2 to Zoubir 20 and is not relevant to  the 
substance of  the Enforceability Application s (at least insofar as they concern Mr 
Thomas) .  For the avoidance of doubt, Mr Thomas should not thereby be taken to accept 
the accuracy or relevance of any matters stated in Appendix 2  of Zoubir 20  and will 
respond further if  that becomes  necessary.   
D. THE HARBOUR IA – KEY TERMS  
81. As I have explained above the Orb Claimants  and Harbour entered into the Harbour IA 
on or around 10 July 2013 . A copy of the Harbour IA is at  pages 280 -374. I set out below 
the main terms of the Harbour IA, as relevant to the Enforceability Applications . Unless 
stated to the contrary, I adopt below the capitalised definitions set out in  the Harbour IA.  A1.6/124
 
 
 
 27 (1) Definitions  
82. In the Harbour IA, t he following definitions  in Clause 1.1  are material:  
82.1. ‘Claimants’  means  Orb, Mr Taylor, and Mr Thomas  (page 284 ); 
82.2. ‘HF2’  means  Harbour and t he ‘HF2 Investment’  is defined in the following 
terms:   
“the aggregate amount of the Claimants’ Legal Costs and Adverse Costs Orders that 
HF2 has paid, incurred or, in the case of Adverse Costs, provisioned a liability in 
respect thereof under this Agreement, PROVIDED that for purposes of calculating the 
2-4 times multiple in Schedule 2, t he HF2 Investment shall be equal to the aggregate 
gross amount of the Claimants’ Legal Costs and Adverse Costs so paid, incurred or 
provisioned by HF2 without giving effect to any subsequent payments received by HF2 
(including following an interim recovery  under clause 11) or prior discharge of any 
such amounts or liabilities by the Claimants or any other person .” (page 285 ) 
82.3. ‘Proceeds’  is defined in the following terms:  
““Proceeds” means any amount of money or the value of any goods, services or 
benefits, recovered or received by the Claimants or its Affiliates as a result of 
Success in the Proceedings and/or Settlement (including the present value of any 
goods, services or benefits to be paid in the future and the present value of any new 
commerc ial arrangements entered into with, or at the direction of, the Claimants or 
their Affiliates or otherwise), and shall include interest and any sums recovered in 
the Proceedings by way of legal costs and ex gratia payments in respect thereof. 
Proceeds shal l be the gross amount prior to any set -off or counterclaim exercised 
by the Defendant or prior to any deduction for taxes payable to any governmental 
authority ”. (page 286 ) 
82.4. ‘Settlement’  mean s: 
“… an agreement between the Claimants and any Defendant, or their respective 
Affiliates, in settlement of the claim made in respect of any of the Causes of Action, 
whether in the Proceedings or otherwise. This shall include any waiver or 
compromise of the Pro ceedings against a Defendant and shall include a decision by 
the Claimants to abandon, withdraw or discontinue the Proceedings .” (page 286 ) 
82.5. ‘Success in the Proceedings’  is defined as : 
“any judgment, award, Settlement, or third party agreement between the Claimants 
or its Affiliates and any other person arising out of or related including any direct 
or indirect consequential outcome resulting in a monetary financial benefit to the 
Claimants and/or any of its Affiliates .” (page 286 ) 
82.6. ‘Trust’  means “ the trust created under clause 8 and any other applicable A1.6/125
 
 
 
 28 provision of [the Harbour IA] ” and ‘Trust Beneficiaries’ means “ the parties 
named in clauses 9.1, 10.2, 11.1, 14.4, 15.5 and Schedule 2 as beneficiaries of 
the Trust, namely HF2 and the Claimants .” (page 287 ) 
(2) Return on investment  
83. Harbour agreed , subject to certain conditions : 
“… (d) to invest in respect of the Claimants’ Legal Costs the specific amounts set out in 
the Agreed Budget and Timeline for each stage of the Proceedings, up to an aggregate 
amount of £ 5,280,000 (the “Aggregate HF2 Commitment’); and […]” (Clause 2.1 ). (page 
287) 
84. Clause 8.1  (within the section headed ‘Declaration of Trust’) states that (page 296 )): 
84.1. The Proceeds were to  be held on bare trust by the Claimants (including Mr 
Thomas ) for the benefit of the Claimants and Harbour; and  
84.2. The Claimants as trustees of the Trust were to  hold the Proceeds on trust for the 
Trust Beneficiaries “ to the extent of the interests of the Trust Beneficiaries ” (the 
“Harbour Trust ”).  
85. Clause 9  (‘Success in Proceedings’ ) further stipulates the following waterfall  (the 
“Waterfall ”) for the distribution of the Proceeds received as a result of Success in the 
Proceedings:  
“9.1 Subject to clause 9.3, the Claimants shall apply  or instruct the Legal Representatives 
to apply any Proceeds  received as a result of Success in the Proceedings, and which it 
holds on trust, in the following order  immediately upon receipt of such Proceeds:  
“(a) deduct all stamp duties, bank charges and currency exchange costs payable by the 
Claimants relating to or arising out of any such Success in the Proceedings;  
(b) pay to HF2 the HF2 Investment after taking into account any prior payments 
received by HF2  (including following an interim recovery under clause 11) or prior 
discharge of any such amounts or liabilities by the Claimants or any other person;  
(c) pay any other sums due in respect of Claimants’ Legal Costs;  
(d) pay to the Legal Representatives, Barristers or other parties with whom the A1.6/126
 
 
 
 29 Claimants has concluded a Legal Costs Agreement any success fee or costs uplift 
payable under any such Legal Costs Agreement;  
(e) pay to HF2 any amount due to it in its Capacity as Trust Beneficiary pursuant to 
Schedule 2 ; and  
(f) pay to the Claimants any remaining amounts , which the Claimants shall receive in 
their capacity as Trust Beneficiaries.  
[…] 
9.3 In the event the Proceeds are insufficient to pay in full the amounts owed under sub -
clauses 9.1(d) and 9.1(e), the Proceeds payable under these sub -clauses shall be 
apportioned pro rata in relation to the amounts owed amongst the parties entitled 
thereunder. The Claimants’ right to resort to Trust property to discharge the payment 
obligation in clause 9.1(d) shall be adjusted accordingly.  
9.4 The obligations of the Claimants under this clause 9 are joint and several. ” 
86. Schedule 2  provides, inter alia , for Harbour’s  recovery under Clause 9.1(e)  as follows:  
Time from date of this Agreement to 
date of receipt by HF2 of the Proceeds 
(subject to the provisions of clause 14)  Proceeds on Trust payable to HF2  
Up to 6 months   20% of the Proceeds up to and including 
£40,000,000 (but in any case, after repayment of the 
HF2 Investment, an amount no less than 2 times the 
HF2 Investment)  
6-12 months  30% of the Proceeds up to and including 
£40,000,000 (but in any case, after repayment of the 
HF2 Investment, an amount no less than 3 times the 
HF2 Investment)  
Over 12 months  35% of the Proceeds up to and including 
£40,000,000 (but in any case, after repayment of the 
HF2 Investment, an amount no less than 4 times the 
HF2 Investment)  
Any Time Period  10% of the Proceeds in excess of £40,000,000 up to 
and including £80,000,000  
Any Time Period  5% of the Proceeds in excess of £80,000,000  
 A1.6/127
 
 
 
 30 87. The percentages set out  in this table  in relation to ‘Any Time Period’ (i.e. the fourth and 
fifth rows in the above table) appear to me to apply to any recoveries, irrespective of 
when they are made, in addition to the time -limited percentage entitlements set out in the 
first to third rows, wherever recoveries exceed £40  million.  
(3) Other relevant  provisions – Clauses 10.2, 12.1, and 14.4  
88. I also wish to draw the Court’s attention to the following provisions  which are relevant 
to the Enforceability Applications .   
89. Clause 10.2  of the Harbour IA provides:  
“Where, pursuant to clause 4.2(i), the Claimants receive a recommendation from the Legal 
Representatives to accept an offer of Settlement made on behalf of one or more Defendants 
(the "Recommended Offer”) but the Claimants elect to reject the Recommended Of fer, if 
the Proceeds eventually recovered from such Defendant or Defendants are less than the 
amount of the Recommended Offer , the Claimants shall hold such Proceeds on bare Trust 
absolutely for the benefit of HF2 and the Claimants and to the extent of the ir interests as 
Trust Beneficiaries The Claimants shall additionally keep such Proceeds separate from 
the Claimants' own funds and shall apply the Proceeds received as a result of Success in 
the Proceedings in the following order  upon receipt of such Proceeds:  
(a) deduct all stamp duties, bank charges and currency exchange costs payable by the 
Claimants relating to or arising out of any such Success in the Proceedings;  
(b) pay to HF2 the HF2 Investment;  
(c) pay any other sums due in respect of Claimants’ Legal Costs;  
(d) pay to the Legal Representatives, Barristers or other third parties with whom the 
Claimants have concluded a Legal Costs Agreement any success fee or costs uplift 
payable under any such Legal Costs Agreement;  
(e) pay to HF2 any amount due to it in its capacity as Trust Beneficiary pursuant to 
Schedule 2  save that  the percentage of Proceeds payable to HF2 shall be calculated 
by reference to the amount of the Recommended Offer and not by reference to the 
amount of the Proceeds ; and  
(f) pay to the Claimants any remaining amount which the Claimants shall receive in 
their capacity as Trust Beneficiaries .” (emphasis added)  
90. Clause 12.1  provides:  
“In the event that any of the Claimants receives any sum from any third party in respect of 
any matter relating to the Causes of Action, including sums received as rebates on VAT A1.6/128
 
 
 
 31 paid by the Claimants in respect on the Claimants' Legal Costs, the Claimants shall treat 
the said sum as part of the sums recovered and/or part of the Proceeds and it shall be part 
of the Trust created under clause  8.” 
91. I also bring to the Court’s attention  Clause 14.4  which provide s for both the payment of 
interest and the payment of a sum as a DBA in specified circumstances : 
“14.4 In the event that the Claimants continue with the Proceedings after the Termination Date 
and the Claimants subsequently Succeed in such Proceedings, the Claimants agree on a joint 
and several basis that:  
(a) they will hold all Proceeds on bare Trust absolutely for the Claimants and HF2 and to 
the extent of their interests as Trust Beneficiaries, such Proceeds will be kept separate 
from the Claimants' own funds and the Claimants shall as trustee of the Trus t forthwith 
pay to HF2 an amount from the Proceeds corresponding to:  
(i) the HF2 Investment up to the Termination Date ; and  
(ii) a sum calculated by applying 10% per annum on the amounts referred to in 
subclause 14.4(a)(i) , calculated from the date of each payment out (or assumption of 
liability for Adverse Costs) by HF2 to the date of refund to HF2 by the Claimants.  
(b) The provisions of clauses 8 and 9 and payment to HF2 under the Trust, will apply as if 
this Agreement had continued in force, SAVE THAT the amount of Proceeds payable to 
HF2 under Schedule 2 shall be fixed by reference to the Termination Date and not the date 
of receipt of monies by HF2 following Success in the Proceedings; and  
(c) the Claimants shall not be obliged to make payments to HF2 under the terms of this 
Trust that are more than the Proceeds it recovers.  
For the avoidance of doubt, this clause 14.4 shall survive any termination of this 
Agreement .” (emphasis added)  
92. Legal submissions  will be made  in due course , to the extent necessary, about the proper 
interpretation and effect of these provisions, together with their implications for the 
Enforceability Applications . I do not set out those here.  
E. THE SCOPE OF THE ENFORCEABILITY APPLICATIONS  
(1) Pre-Action Correspondence  
93. Mr Thomas and Harbour engaged in extensive pre -action correspondence about the 
various issues arising from the PACCAR decision and their implications for the Harbour A1.6/129
 
 
 
 32 IA. In particular, I draw to the Court’s attention  the following substantive correspondence 
which sets out the parties’ respective positions  and the dispute which now remains : 
93.1. MH’s  detailed  Letter Before Action  (the “LBA ”) dated 11 July 2024  (pages 
781-800); 
93.2. Harcus Parker ’s letter of 26 July 2024  to MH stating that it would be filing  with 
the Jersey Court on 2 August 2024  draft  evidence  in support of its proposed 
application to this Court ; that it was prepared to share that evidence  
simultaneously  with MH; and that it would set out Harbour’s position in detail 
on the points raised in the LBA  (pages 801 -803);    
93.3. That draft  evidence ( in the form of the Draft Zoubir Statement ), which  was sent 
to MH on 2 August 2024 (pages 482 -540); and 
93.4. Subsequent  correspondence between Harcus Parker  and MH dated  7 August 
2024 (pages 804 -808); 23 August 2024  (pages 809 -816); 9 September 2024 
(pages 817 -821); and 25 September 2024 (pages 822 -828). 
(the “ Pre-Action Correspondence ”).  
94. As I have explained  above, Harbour  told the Jersey Court that it intended to  bring an 
application for declarations concerning the enforceability or otherwise of the Harbour IA  
by the early autumn (of 2024)  (page 471 ), and told Mr Thomas that it first wished to 
engage in the Pre -Action Correspondence to narrow the issues as far as reasonably 
possible . This Pre -Action Correspondence failed to resolve the dispute.  
95. When it became clear that the Pre -Action Correspondence had achieved all that it 
realistically could , MH’s  letter  dated  25 September  2024  (pages 822 -828) concluded as 
follows:  
“To conclude:  
(i)  It is obvious from your letter that the pre -action period is now at an end.  
(ii)  We now invite your client to confirm by return that it will issue its promised application A1.6/130
 
 
 
 33 within 14 days of today.  [i.e. by 9 October 2024 ]  
(iii)  If your client is not prepared to issue its application in this time, please inform us forthwith.  
(iv)  Please also respond clearly, directly and promptly to the three questions set out in 
paragraph 13 of our letter of 30 July 2024 and repeated in paragraphs 17 -18 above 
regarding the Debarring Directions Order. ” (page s 827-828). 
96. Harcus Parker  wrote to MH on 9 October 2024 agree ing that the Pre -Action 
Correspondence had reached its end (§2) and confirming that it anticipated filing its 
application “before the end of the week commencing 21 October 2024, if not sooner ” (§8) 
(page 830 ). As it was,  the Harbour A pplication  was only filed on  31 October 2024.  
97. Mr Thomas now responds to th e Harbour A pplication and makes the Thomas Cross -
Application . The Court is therefore asked  to resolve the remaining  issues in dispute  along 
(it would appear) with some additional arguments raised by Harbour for the first time in 
Zoubir 20 .12 
(2) The remaining issues  
98. Zoubir 20  accepts , at least , that part of the Harbour IA is a  DBA  and that  the DBA  is not 
compliant with  the relevant legislation  (§81).  
99. Following the Pre -Action Correspondence , and having regard to Zoubir 20,  the 
remaining dispute  appears to concern  the following issues (the “ Issues ”): 
99.1. The full extent  of the non -compliance of the  key parts of the  Harbour IA 
identified in the LBA  (the “ Remaining DBA Issues ”). In sum, it is Mr Thomas’ 
case that the Harbour IA is partly unenforceable by Harbour because that or 
those parts is/are a DBA  for the purposes of s.58AA of the  CLSA 1990  and 
fail(s) to comply with the provisions of the CLSA 1990 and/or the DBA Regs 
2013.  Mr Thomas contends that: (i) key parts of the Harbour IA  which fall to be 
considered a DBA  is/are non-compliant with the relevant legislation in a number 
of material respects  explained below ; and (ii)  accordingly, those parts are 
 
12 A comparison between the Draft Zoubir Statement and Zoubir 20 demonstrates that a series of new points are 
now being advanced  by Harbour , including an aspect of its argument on severance and its wholly new case on 
estoppel by deed.  A1.6/131
 
 
 
 34 unenforceable  by Harbour.  This is addressed in Section F below . 
99.2. Whether  Harbour is entitled  to amend the Harbour IA (specifically, parts of 
Schedule 2)  by severing non-compliant  provisions  so as to leave in place an 
otherwise compliant and effective agreement (the “ Severance Issue ”). Mr 
Thoma s contend s that Harbour’s proposed form of severance  is not permissible  
as a matter of law  and, even if it was,  the relevant parts of the  Harbour IA would 
still fail to comply with the relevant legislation . This is addressed in Section G 
below . 
99.3. Whether Mr Thomas is time -barred from bringing the Thomas Cross -
Application or , it appears  from the position taken by Harbour , even from 
defending the Harbour Application (the “ Limitation Issue ”). This is addressed 
in Section H below . 
99.4. Whether it is otherwise an abuse of the Court’s process for Mr Thomas to seek 
the relief set out in the Thomas Cross -Application  and (it would also seem from 
the position taken by Harbour) even  to defend the Harbour Application  (the 
“Abuse Issue ”). This is addressed in Section H below.  
100. The remainder of this statement  explains Mr Thomas’ position on each of the Issues 
together with the relief he seeks in the Thomas Cross -Application , subject to the detailed 
legal submissions he will make in due course.  
101. For completeness, I note that some potential legal  issues  have been mentioned by 
Harbour only by name and are not explained further (see, for example, Zoubir 20 at 
§114). I address these below to the extent possible in light of Harbour’s failure to 
articulate them.  Mr Thomas will address these them further once Harbour has properly 
explained its case in these aspects.  A1.6/132
 
 
 
 35 F. THE REMAINING DBA ISSUES  
(1) The DBA and non-compliance  
102. As mentioned above, i n the Pre -Action C orrespondence (and now in Zoubir 20) Harbour 
has accepted  that at least parts of  the Harbour IA are required to, but do not, comply with 
at least some requirements of the DBA Regs 2013 . 
103. In summary, Mr Thomas’  position is as follows : 
103.1.  Pursuant to the  Harbour  IA, Harbour provided financial services and/or 
assistance to ( inter alia ) Mr Thomas in relation to the making of a claim (the 
Original Proceedings  referred to above ). 
103.2.  Per the key terms of the Harbour IA set out above, the Harbour IA provides that, 
in the event of Success in the Proceedings  (as defined) , a series of payment s are 
to be made to Harbour in accordance with Clause 9.1(a) -(e), including  (per 
Clause 9.1(e) ) a payment or payments calculated by reference to the amount of 
the financial benefit obtained ( set out in Schedule 2 ). 
103.3.  In the circumstances, Mr Thomas ’ case is  that significant portions of the 
Harbour IA is/are a DBA . Specifically : 
103.3.1.  Clause s 9.1(a) -(e) (or each of them) , together with Schedule 2 , 
constitute (s) the (or a)  DBA .  
103.3.2.  Alternatively, Clause 9 .1(e), together with Schedule 2 , constitute (s) 
the (or a)  DBA . 
103.3.3.  In the further alternative , Schedule 2  alone constitutes the (or a) 
DBA . 
103.3.4.  On all of the above cases, Clauses 10.2, 12.1 , and /or 14.4 are also 
part of the (or a) DBA , or are themselves DBA elements  within the 
Harbour IA . A1.6/133
 
 
 
 36 103.4.  The above portions of the  Harbour IA fail to comply with various provisions of 
s.58AA(4) CLSA 1990  and the DBA Regs 2013  relating to DBAs . 
103.5.  Consequently,  the key parts of the Harbour IA constituting the (or a) DBA are 
unenforceable by Harbour against  Mr Thomas  (and the other  Orb Claimants ). 
104. Relevantly, I note the following admissions made by Harbour in Zoubir 20 (and in the 
Pre-Action Correspondence) about the effect of the CLSA 1990  and DBA Regs 2013  
and their impact on the Harbour IA : 
104.1.  First, Harbour concedes that the Harbour IA contains two elements of a DBA 
identified in  s.58AA(3) of the CLSA 1990  in that: (i) it involves the provision 
of “claims management services ”; and (ii) that service is provided in return for 
a payment that is: (a) contingent on the success of the Causes of Action; and ( b) 
calculated as a proportion of the financial benefit obtained by the Orb Claimants 
from that success13 (Zoubir 20 , §§75, 76 and 7 9-80); 
104.2.  Second , Harbour concedes that the Harbour IA does not comply with the 
requirement , imposed by Regulation  3(c) of the DBA Regs 201 3, that the 
Harbour IA specify  the reason for setting the amount of its return at  the levels 
mentioned in Schedule 2  (Zoubir 20 , §81) (page 510 ). Specifically  (Breach 1) , 
the DBA  within the Harbour IA  fails to set out : (i) the reason for any of the 
percentage entitlements at the levels provided for in Schedule 2  (and therefore  
also by Clause 9.1(e) , which incorporates  Schedule 2 ); (ii) the reason for the ir 
escalations  (encompassing both the reason for there being escalations at all and 
the particular escalations included ); or (iii) the reason for there being a further, 
general uplift to be applied in specified circumstances  (e.g. the ‘Any Time 
Period’ allowances) . 
105. I also note that Zoubir 20  at §79 seeks to give precisely the kind of reasons which needed 
 
13 This last point was implicitly conceded by the comment  in §§70-71 of the Draft Zoubir Statement  (page 505 -
506). My firm noted Harbour’s  apparent concession  on the proportion point  in my firm’s letter of 23 August 2024 
(¶15(iii)) (page 813 ). Harcus Parker  did not address  this in Harbour’s response dated 9 September 2024 (pages 
817-821). I believe its silence  is to be regard ed as a tacit acknowledgment that my interpretation of this part of the 
Draft Zoubir Statement was correct.  Those passages of the Draft Zoubir Statement are  substantially  retained in 
Zoubir 20 (served following the above -referenced inter partes  correspondence ): see Zoubir 20, §§ 79-80, with 
some deleted references to Dr Cochrane .  A1.6/134
 
 
 
 37 to be  (but were not)  included within the DBA element of the Harbour IA  to comply with 
Regulation 3(c) . 
106. These are important admissions , as noted in  MH’s letter  dated  23 August 2024  (pages 
809-816). 
(2) Other material non-compliance  
107. Whilst, as above, Harbour concedes non -compliance  in the respect referred to above , Mr 
Thomas contends that  the DBA element(s) of the Harbour IA is /are, in fact , also non-
compliant with the CLSA 1990 and/or the DBA Regs 2013 in several other important 
respects  explained below .  
108. There are, I believe,  at least  four further  breaches of the DBA Regs 2013  in relation to 
Regulation 4(3) : 
108.1.  Breach 2. Clause s 9.1(a) -(e) and Schedule 2  of the Harbour  IA provide for  a 
potential  payment to  Harbour of an amount (substantially)  above 50% of the 
sums ultimately recovered by the Orb Claimants . This is prohibited under 
Regulation 4(3). Illustrative examples of this non -compliance were  set out by 
Mr Thomas  in his LBA  (§§42-51) (pages 796 -797). 
108.2.  By way of illustration : 
108.2.1.  Harbour asserted in a letter dated 2 July 2021  (pages 773 -780) that 
the total estimated realisable value of the assets held within the 
Harbour Trust pursuant to the Harbour IA at that time was 
£23,865,935.70;   
108.2.2.  Harbour went on in that letter t o state that, on the assumption its 
valuation was correct (which, as I state above, is disputed  by Mr 
Thomas ), the minimum to which Harbour would be entitled under 
the Harbour IA was £25,945,052.40 comprising payment of the HF2 
Investment (as defined) and the return calculated under Schedule 2  A1.6/135
 
 
 
 38 to the same ; and  
108.2.3.  On this basis, Harbour envisaged that it would take 100%  of the 
Proceeds (as defined ) and the funded parties would receive nothing 
under the Harbour IA , under the terms of  Clauses 9.1(b) and 9.1(e) 
and Schedule 2 .  
108.3.  Breach 3. Clause 10.2  of the Harbour IA provides in essence  an alternative 
waterfall by which , if the  Orb Claimants, including Mr Thomas, refuse to accept  
an offer they are recommended to accept, and then recover less than that offer, 
the payment  due to Harbour  would (pursuant to Clause 10.2(e) ) be based on the 
amount of the rejected offer  rather than the Proceeds (as defined) in fact 
recovered. Hence the Harbour IA again asserts a right for Harbour  (potentially ) 
to be paid  an amount above 50% of the sums ultimately recovered by the Orb 
Claimants , and is a  second  breach of Regulation 4(3).   
108.4.  Breach 4. Clause 12.1  of the Harbour IA  again provides , in certain  
circumstances, for a payment to  Harbour in excess of 50%  of recoveries by 
artificially inflating or broadening the scope of the Proceeds /recoveries  against 
which Harbour’s purported entitlements are assessed  (i.e. beyond actual 
recoveries to include ‘any sum from any third party in respect of any matter 
relating to the Causes of Action, including sums received as rebates on VAT 
paid by the Claimants in respect o f the Claimants ’ Legal Costs ).  
108.5.  Breach 5. Clause 14.4 (ii) of the Harbour IA provides for a payment  to Harbour  
from the Proceeds  of an amount  corresponding to the HF 2 Investment and 
interest thereon of 10% per annum,  which was always capable  of amounting to 
more than 50% of the Proceeds. This  means that (combined) there  was always 
the possibility that the Orb Claimants would be required by its terms to pay 
Harbour  an amount above 50% of the sums ultimately recovered by the Orb 
Claimants .  
109. Finally  (Breach 6), I believe that the relevant part(s) of the Harbour IA  breach (es) A1.6/136
 
 
 
 39 Regulation 4(1)  of the DBA Rega 2013 in that it fails to ‘net off’ recovered costs from 
the sums claimable in  or by reference to  Schedule 2 .   
110. As was noted in Mr Thomas’  LBA  (pages 781 -800): 
110.1.  Whilst the (purported) payment liabilities of the  Orb Claimants are contained in 
the Waterfall, and each element is deducted before moving to the next item, 
Clause 9.1(e)  simply provides for payment to the Trust Beneficiaries (including 
Harbour ) out of amounts calculated by reference to the formula  set out  in 
Schedule 2 . 
110.2.  Schedule 2  provides for percentage and multiplier calculations in respect of the 
“Proceeds ” where, a s explained in paragraph  82.3 above, ‘Proceeds’ is a defined 
term to include gross sums which are not net of , for example, inter partes  costs 
recoveries . 
110.3.  Clause  9.1(e)  and/or Schedule 2  provide for the percentage  payments to be 
made to Harbour without  ‘netting off’ the costs from those payments . 
111. This, I believe,  is a clear breach of Regulation  4(1). 
112. Taking those matters in the round, Mr Thomas contends that there is material  (and 
substantial)  non-compliance by the DBA element (s) of the Harbour IA with the DBA 
Regs 2013 . 
(3) Enforceability  
113. The effect of the DBA elements of t he Harbour IA’s non -compliance  with the DBA Regs 
2013  is principally a matter for legal submissions in due course and is/are not explained 
in detail here.  
114. By way of summary, however, Mr Thomas ’ position is  that: 
114.1.  The DBA  elements of the Harbour IA  (summarised in paragraph 103.3  above)  
are unenforceable  by Harbour  as against Mr Thomas and the other funded 
parties under the Harbour IA  under s.58AA(2) of the CLSA, which provides A1.6/137
 
 
 
 40 that “ [a DBA] which does not satisfy [the requirements of the DBA Regs 2013] 
is unenforceable ”. 
114.2.  Harbour is thus not entitled to any  payment  under  Clauses 9.1 (a)-(e), on Mr 
Thomas’ primary case , or alternatively is not entitled to any payment calculated 
by reference to Clause 9.1(e)  and/or Schedule 2 .  
G. HARBOUR’S SEVERANCE ARGUMENT  
(1) The proposed  form of severance  
115. Harbour asserted in the Pre -Action C orrespondence that it intends to rely on Clause 25.1  
of the Harbour IA in an attempt to save at least some of the key provisions impugned by 
Mr Thomas,  in circumstances where (at least) aspects of it are plainly non -compliant with 
the CLSA 1990  and/or DBA Regs 2013 , as set out above  (see paragraphs 101 -115 of the 
draft 20th Zoubir witness statement provided pre -action to MH on 2 August 2024 ( pages 
515-520)) 
116. Clause 25.1  states:  
“If any term or provision in this Agreement shall in whole or in part be held to any extent to be 
illegal or unenforceable under any enactment or rule of law, that term or provision or part shall 
to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement and the enforceability of the 
remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected ” (page 304 ). 
117. For the first time, Zoubir 20 identifies a further facet to Harbour’s severance argument, 
which is that (Harbour says) there is a difference in the approach to be taken where the 
Court is concerned with a contractual severance clause  rather than severance at common 
law (Zoubir 20, §120 ). Specifically, Harbour contends that this circumvents the elements 
of the common law test which cause its proposed form of severance so much difficulty:  
“This is a straightforward exercise in contractual interpretation which does not require reference 
to the general common law principles concerning severance, or to satisfy the general common 
law test. In particular, in the contractual interpretation context  the court is not limited to 
deletions, it does not matter whether there is surplus language left over and there is no need to 
consider whether the overall balance of the contract remains the same .” (Zoubir 20, §120)  
(emphasis added).  
118. These are  legal submission s (the bas es for which are not articulated in Zoubir 20)  which A1.6/138
 
 
 
 41 Mr Thomas will address in due course.  For now, Harbour appears to stand by the so -
called ‘Modified Schedule 2’ in Zoubir 20 (“Modified Schedule 2 ”) and contends  that 
the words struck through in Modified Schedule 2  could be severed from Schedule 2  so 
as to leave an otherwise compliant and enforceable agreement.  
119. Harbour’s proposed form of severance (which, for the avoidance of doubt, Mr Thomas 
disputes) is as follows , with Harbour’s proposed deletions from Schedule 2  struck 
through with red lines : 
 
120. I note that Harbour proposes no severance to Clause s 9, 12.1, and/or 14.4 and does not 
address the breaches arising in relation to those Clauses referred to above .  
A1.6/139
 
 
 
 42 (2) Defects in Harbour’s proposed form of severance  regarding Schedule 2  
121. I make the following observations about Harbour’s proposed form of severance  in 
relation to Schedule 2  to the Harbour IA , bearing in mind that Mr Thomas’ full position 
will be articulated in legal submissions in due course . 
122. First, even assuming the Modified Schedule 2 meets the test for severance (which, as 
below, Mr Thomas does not accept) , the text which is proposed to be severed is not the 
only wording in the relevant portions of the Harbour IA which pr ovides for a “percentage  
based recovery ” (to use , without admission,  the description  in Zoubir 20 ).  
123. Second , Mr Thomas will contend in any event  that the words proposed to be severed  
cannot, in fact, be severed  under Clause 25.1  or at common law  because  (without 
limitation  and without rehearsing the detailed legal submissions which will be made in 
due course) : 
123.1.  There is no  justifiable  basis for deletin g “(but in any case, ” from  Schedule 2  
because,  as explained in the Pre -Action Correspondence (see paragraph 18 of 
MH’s  letter dated 23 August 2024 (pages 813 -814), it is only a term or provision 
that is illegal or unenforceable that may be severed. The text and words quoted 
above  (“(but in any case, ”) are neither illegal nor unenforceable , and Harbour 
does not seem to contend otherwise . Mr Thomas’ position is that Harbour is not 
entitled to  sever them merely because it finds them inconvenient . 
123.2.  Moreover , Zoubir 20  is, I believe,  wrong to say ( at §123 ) that, “ the Modified 
Schedule 2 provisions are workable, and do not require any re -writing or 
amendment in order to be understood ”. All that the Modified Schedule 2  would  
provide  (if so modified) is that, after repayment of the HF2 Investment, Harbour 
is entitled to “ an amount no less than  [x] times the HF2 Investment ” (emphasis 
added) . That is not a statement of the sum to which Harbour would  be entitled; 
it is just a statement of one criterion  applicable to the calculation of that sum 
without there being any other basis in the agreement for calculating the sum. For 
the Modified Schedule  2 to provide the necessary certainty  as to Harbour’s 
payment entitlement  it would need to  add words to enable that sum to be A1.6/140
 
 
 
 43 calculated (which  Mr Thomas contends  is not permissible) . 
123.3.  Further , Modified Schedule 2  would effect a major change in the nature of the 
Harbour IA  (which Mr Thomas  also contends is not permissible) , for example  
(and without limitation)  by significantly alter ing the basis on which Harbour’s  
payment entitlements  would be calculated (e.g. the deletion of percentage 
entitlements  and retention (only) of multiplie r entitlements ) and/or the amount 
likely to be paid to Harbour in various circumstances (e.g. the deletion of the 
‘Any Time Period’ entitlements).  
124. These points were  put to Harbour in the Pre -Action Correspondence , including by 
reference to the applicable legal principles (not rehearsed herein) . I draw the Court’s 
attention in particular to  paragraphs 18 -22 of MH’s letter dated 23 August 2024 (pages 
813-814) which were  substantially unaddressed  by Harbour in its responsive letter dated 
9 September 2024 (pages 817 -821). Indeed, Harbour stated at paragraphs 13 -14 of that 
letter merely that:  
“13. As to paragraphs 18 and 19 of Your Letter, Harbour maintains its position as to the  
application of the principles of severability and/or characterisation as an agreement other  than 
a DBA.  
14. With regard to paragraphs 20 to 23 of Your Letter, Mr Zoubir’s draft statement addresses 
these matters in some detail. Harbour maintains the position set out therein, and nothing in Your 
Letter alters its views in this regard .” (page 820 ). 
125. Regrettably, Harbour’s failure to  engag e with the issues in its case on severance is 
repeated  in Zoubir 20 , such that Mr Thomas still does not know Harbour’s response to 
those points (if indeed it has  one):  
“I note also that in pre -action correspondence, having received the draft of this Application, 
Marriot Harrison has indicated that Mr Thomas disagrees with Harbour application of the 
principles of severability in respect of the proposed Modified Schedule 2. These objections would 
only appear to have application to the common law approach not the exercise in contractual 
interpretation referred to above. Harbour reserves its position in this regard, including as to the 
further modification of Schedule 2 and any arguments about how the surviving wording may be 
interpreted, pending receipt of Mr Thomas’s responsive evidence .” (Zoubir 20, § 121).  
126. I respectfully submit  that Harbour should  articulate its case on severance  now, including 
its answer to Mr Thomas’ responsive arguments , of which it has been aware for some A1.6/141
 
 
 
 44 time, so that Mr Thomas has a fair opportunity to consider and respond to them . 
H. HARBOUR’S ALTERNATIVE ABUSE OF PROCESS AND LIMITATION 
ARGUMENT S 
127. As an alternative way of escaping the consequences of the  CLSA 1990 and the  DBA 
Regs 2013 , Harbour alternatively  contends  that Mr Thomas is time -barred from 
ventilating those arguments  and/or that it would be  abusive for him to do so (in both 
respects, even, it seems, in response (and opposition ) to the Harbour A pplication  to which 
Harbour recognises Mr Thomas should be made a Respondent because his interests are 
very obviously affected by it ).  
(1) Limitation  
128. First, Harbour contends  that Mr Thomas’ arguments above are time -barred. This is a 
matter for legal submissions in due course although I refer the Court to the parties’ Pre-
Action C orrespondence on this point: specifically, my firm’s letter of 23 August 2024 
(paras. 9 -13) (pages 811 -812) and Harbour’s response dated 9 September 2024 (para. 
11) (page 820 ). 
129. Harbour’s limitation argument is difficult to follow but appears to be as follows : 
129.1.  Paragraph 11 of Harcus Parker’s letter of 9 September 2024  (page 820 ) 
identified section 5 of the 1980 Act  as the basis of Harbour ’s limitation 
argument , stating as follows:  
“On the face of things, a claim for repayment of money following a finding that the 
Harbour IA is unenforceable would fall within section 5 of the LA 1980, and the 
PACCAR Decision declares what the statutory framework has always meant ...” 
129.2.  Quite apart from the generality , and lack of explanation,  of this position (and 
without prejudice to the more detailed submissions  Mr Thomas will make in due 
course ), I note that the relief sought by Mr Thomas in the Thomas Cross -
Application involves no claim for repayment of monies by Harbour (or any other 
entity).  My firm pointed this out in Mr Thomas’ response (pages 822 -828). A1.6/142
 
 
 
 45 129.3.  For the avoidance of doubt, Mr Thomas has been upfront about the relief he 
intends to seek : see MH’s  letter of 25 September  2024  (§13)  (pages 823 -824). 
130. In any event, Harbour’s  time-bar argument  seems to me to be inconsistent with  its own 
application for (among other things)  mirror -image declaratory relief  in relation to the 
validity of  the Harbour IA, i.e. a declaration that it is enforceable by Harbour . This is set 
out in  Harbour’s draft order in support the Harbour Application . Again, MH made this 
point in the Pre -Action Correspondence14 (before the Harbour Application was issued) 
without adequate reply . Zoubir 20  does not address this poi nt (either) – i.e. the basis on 
which Harbour contends that a claim for declaratory relief by Mr Thomas as summarised 
above can be said to be time -barred . Harbour will have an opportunity to  set out its 
position on this clearly in its responsive evidence , and should do so that Mr Thomas can 
understand the argument he is expected to meet in good time before the hearing of the 
Enforceability Applications . If it fails to do so, I believe that Harbour should be 
debarred /prevented  from pursuing a time -bar argument.  
131. For completeness, I note that Zoubir 20 also raise s “laches ” as a possible basis for 
denying Mr Thomas the relief he seeks  (Zoubir 20, § 141). This is the first time laches 
has been raised. Mr Zoubir does not explain the basis for this  alternative  argument.  As a 
result,  and again,  Mr Thomas does not know the case he has to meet in this regard  and 
Harbour is invited to set outs  its position clearly in its responsive evidence , failing which 
I believe it should  be debarred /prevented  from pursuing this point.  
(2) Abuse of process  
132. Harbour alternatively argues that Mr Thomas could and should have litigated an 
argument  that the  DBA element (s) of the  Harbour IA was /were  unenforceable by 
Harbour “ at any time after it was agreed ” (Zoubir 20 , §98) and any attempt to make these 
arguments now would be “ abusive ”. Mr Zoubir goes on:  
“... the Smith Parties [defined by Mr Zoubir to include Mr Thomas] have had ample opportunities 
to argue that the Harbour IA was subject to the DBA regulations and failed to do so.  I would 
respectfully suggest that these matters are res judicata, or give rise to cause of action or issue 
estoppel, or that it would be abusive, for reasons that will be expanded upon in submissions, for 
 
14 MH letter dated 23 August 2024, §13 (page 812 ). A1.6/143
 
 
 
 46 them to be allowed to do so now .” (Zoubir 20, §114).  
133. No proper attempt is made in Zoubir 20  to address the different  legal and factual  elements 
of these (distinct) legal concepts  or to explain in what sense phrases like ‘res judicata’ 
are used.  That, regrettably, is the continuation of Harbour’s  vague and evasive  approach  
to these potential arguments in the Pre -Action Correspondence. As I say above, Mr 
Thomas’ position is that Harbour should explain those arguments in its responsive 
evidence  or be prevented from advancing them at the hearing of the Enforceabilit y 
Applications.   
134. So far as it has been  explained , Harbour’s argument, in essence, is  (as I understand)  that 
Mr Thomas could and should have been aware of the arguments he advances in this 
application as long ago as 2014  and, therefore, raised them at the Directed Trial , because 
Harbour has been able to identify a single academic article  from Professor Rachel 
Mulheron  on the subject dating from November 2014 titled, ‘ England's unique approach 
to the self -regulation of third party funding: A critical analysis of recent developments ’ 
(the “ Mulheron Article ”) (pages 541 -574) which raised (and then dismissed) the 
possibility of litigation funding agreements having to comply with the DBA Regs 2013 .  
135. At this stage, I make the following observations in response : 
135.1.  Mr Thomas is a lay person . The idea that he ought to have been aware of 
complex potential arguments  about the potential invalidity of the  (or part of the)  
Harbour IA prior to the decision of the Supreme Court in PACCAR , when that 
did not even reflect the understanding  of the litigation funding industry and 
specialist litigators, is, I believe, unreasonable . 
135.2.  Indeed,  it seems to me that  the logical result  of Harbour’s argument – that the 
issue was so well -known that a lay person such as Mr Thomas would or should 
have been aware of it – is that  Harbour itself must  or should also have been 
aware that the Harbour IA might well have been  invalid; yet notwithstanding 
that, it allowed the Court to give judgments, make orders , and grant Harbour  
substantial monetary relief which it would  or should have been aware it may not 
have been entitled to , without drawing the Court’s attention to this issue.  I A1.6/144
 
 
 
 47 respectfully suggest this underlines the lack of realism in  Harbour’s argument 
that Mr Thomas  is acting abusively or unconscionably  in seeking a declaration 
that a part or parts of the Harbour IA is /are invalid, given the clarification of the 
law provided in the PACCAR  decision . 
135.3.  To bolster its argument , Harbour  relies on the fact that Mr Thomas was ( at times  
over the last decade or so ) represented by lawyers . However,  that argument 
ignores the reality that none of those  legal teams  were a ware , either,  of the 
potential argument which was eventually vindicated in PACCAR :  
135.3.1.  As noted  above , there was a widespread understanding, common 
both to the litigation funding industry (including Harbour) and 
specialist litigators and academics in this area, that litigation funding 
agreements such as the Harbour IA were not subject to the CLSA 
1990 and/or the DBA Regs 2013   
135.3.2.  The Mulheron Article  which identified a potential counter -argument  
(on which Harbour’s abuse argument appears to rest)  reached the 
strident conclusion  that the counter -argument  “would be bound to 
fail”. 
135.3.3.  So, Harbour’s position  appears to be  that Mr Thomas or one of his 
legal teams should have discovered the Mulheron Article on the 
point (being the only article which Harbour  relies on)  and 
commenced a declaration claim  (presumably at the Directed Trial)  
based on an argument in  the article  its (specialist) author had 
concluded was “bound to fail ”, such as to make it unconscionable to 
pursue that argument now (even in response and opposition to an 
application by Harbour  for essentially mirror -image relief ). I believe 
this to be an unreal argument .  
136. Zoubir 20  contains  a series of vague assertions  that Mr Thomas  had “ extremely 
extensive ”, “ numerous ”, “multiple ” and  
“ample ” opportunities to contest the validity of the Harbour IA during the Directed Trial  A1.6/145
 
 
 
 48 (Zoubir 20, §§107 -108 and §104  (pages 517 -518 and 516 )). However, I note that  his 
statement fails to engage  (even at a high level ) with the issues that were within the scope 
of the Directed Trial .  Mr Zoubir does not identify the issues actually in dispute in the 
Directed Trial ; nor does he explain why, in that context, it would have been reasonable 
for and incumbent on Mr Thomas  to raise the issue of the enforceability of part (s) of the 
Harbour IA  by Harbour  at that time or within the scope of the Directed Trial .  
137. Nor has Harbour ever properly explain ed why it considers Mr Thomas to be abusive in 
bringing points before the Court where (i) Harbour has already informed the Jersey Court 
that, in its view, those points should be positively determined by the English Court, and 
(ii) Harbour has brought  its own application and seek s its own relief in relation to the 
same issues . 
138. Mr Thomas await s a proper explanation of Harbour’s case . In the meantime,  I note tha t 
the enforceability  of the relevant part(s) of the Harbour IA  by Harbour (including as 
against the other beneficiaries of the Harbour Trust ) was not an issue that was in dispute 
at the Directed Trial  (not least where  the Directed Trial preceded the PACCAR  decision  
of the Supreme Court ). Nor was it relevant to the issues that were in dispute at the trial.  
139. Indeed, Harbour’s assertion in its letter of 9 September 2024 (pages 817 -821) that the 
outcome of the whole Directed Trial was based on the premise that the Harbour IA was 
enforceable (in its entirety ) is clearly wrong. The central dispute in the Directed Trial 
was the SFO’s alleged entitlement to particular assets held directly or indirectly by Dr 
Smith and/or Dr Cochrane and/or other parties as against claims to them by third parties. 
The enforceabilit y of the  entirety of the  Harbour IA was not determined  at the Directed 
Trial  (pages 60 -279). 
140. Moreover, the suggestion that Mr Thomas was required at the Directed Trial to argue that 
the relevant part(s) of the Harbour IA are unenforceable on the grounds set out herein  
(or, indeed, that it was even possible  for him to do so) , is fanciful. Whatever the position 
with regard to knowledge of the PACCAR  point  (which is addressed above  and by Mr 
Thomas in his witness statement ), it is important for the Court to understand the 
chronology , which I understand (from reviewing the relevant judgments) to be as A1.6/146
 
 
 
 49 follows : 
140.1.  The Competition Appeal  Tribunal’s (“CAT ”) judgment on the point at first 
instance was handed down on 28 October 2019 (pages 575 -627). The CAT held 
that litigation funding agreements such as the Harbour IA were not DBAs for 
the purposes of the CLSA 1990  and other relevant legislation.   
140.2.  The Court of Appeal’s decision was handed down on or around 5 March 2021  
(pages 628 -674).  It agreed with the CAT  that litigation funding agreements 
such as the Harbour IA were not DBAs and maintained the position set out 
above . 
140.3.  The Directed Trial Judgment was handed down on  18 May 2021 . As above, this 
was at a time when both the CAT and (more importantly) the Court of Appeal 
had positively determined  that litigation funding agreements were  not subject to 
the CLSA 1990 and/or the DBA Regs 2013. (pages 60 -279). 
140.4.  The Supreme Court  appears to have given permission to appeal in the PACCAR 
litigation on 28 April 202215 and did not hear argument in PACCAR until 
February 2023 . The Supreme Court  handed down  its judgment on 26 July 2023 . 
(pages 675 -772). 
141. Accordingly, at the time the Directed Trial Judgment was handed down by Mr Justice 
Foxton, the Court of Appeal’s decision in the PACCAR litigation was the leading 
authority and was directly binding on the High Court . The idea that Mr Thomas was 
wrong not to  have argued  before Mr Justice Foxton for a position which , at the trial,  
would have been  directly contrary to the CAT’s ruling and which (by the time the 
decision was handed down)  was directly contrary to a decision of the Court of Appeal  is, 
I believe,  simply untenable.  
142. On the contrary, even if Mr Thomas had been aware of a PACCAR -style argument at the 
time of the Directed Trial,  I respectfully suggest that  the Court would no doubt have 
 
15 https://www.supremecourt.uk/pta/permission -to-appeal -april-may-2022.html     A1.6/147
 
 
 
 50 rejected the argument instantly  on the same grounds the CAT and Court of Appeal had 
rejected it  (and, as above,  was, by the time of handing down the Directed Trial Judgment, 
bound by higher authority in the form of the Court of Appeal’s decision ).  
143. I believe that t he Court should  also reject the overarching point  made in Zoubir 20 at 
§§109-113 for the same reasons.  
(3) Estoppel  by deed  
144. In Zoubir 20 , Harbour raises (for the first time ) yet another potential argument – that Mr 
Thomas cannot challenge the enforceability of the Harbour IA because of the terms of 
the 2014 Harbour Deed  he signed  (see paragraph 45 above).  This argument did not appear 
in the Pre -Action Correspondence or in the Draft Zoubir Statement .  
145. The basis  of the new estoppel by deed argument  is set out in  Zoubir 20 at §97  as follows : 
“... Mr Thomas (amongst others) agreed that the recoveries under the IOM Settlement were to 
be treated as “Proceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings” for the  purposes of 
Cl 9.1 of the Harbour IA and were to be applied in accordance with the terms of that clause. 
Accordingly, each of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas are estopped by deed from contesting that 
position. ” 
146. This is fundamentally a point of law which will be addressed by Mr Thomas at the 
appropriate time. However, I note for now that Mr Zoubir fails altogether to explain  
(without limitation):  
146.1.  How those words could be  said to give rise to an estoppel , still less one which 
could have the effect of supporting  rights (in favour of Harbo ur) that are 
excluded by  primary and secondary legislation ;  
146.2.  How such an estoppel could arise  where the position fundamentally changed 
following the  Supreme Court  decision in PACCAR , which judgment  did not 
exist  in 2014 when the 2014 Harbour Deed was entered into;  and/or 
146.3.  How the highlighted words of the 2014 Harbour Deed are said to be inconsistent 
with Mr Thomas now contending that Harbour is not entitled to enforce its 
alleged rights under the relevant parts of the Harbour IA.  A1.6/148
 
 
 
 51 147. Lastly, I note that Harbour continues to fail to explain the alleged  basis (if any) for its (at 
present, wholly unarticulated) arguments concerning issue estoppel and/or cause of 
action estoppel. As I say above, it is unfair to Mr Thomas for Harbour to refuse to explain 
the grounds on which it brings the Harbour Application (and, assuming it is defended, 
resists the Thomas Cross -Application), and for Mr Thomas to  be left to  discover the 
nature of those grounds on the eve of a hearing when Harbour serves a s keleton argument.  
I. ORDER S / RELIEF  SOUGHT  
148. In the Pre -Action Correspondence and again in Zoubir 20, Harbour makes the claim that 
Mr Thomas has failed to set out the nature of the relief he intends to seek from the Court 
in relation to the Enforceability Applications. That is incorrect. My firm set out this 
position  clearly  in the Pre -Action Correspondence ( e.g. in paragraph 14 of MH’s letter 
dated 25 September 2024 (page 824 )). Harbour’s response to that letter, provided on 9 
October 2024, merely repeated its (unmerited) accusation that, “ as we have  already set 
out, it is your client who has failed to articulate the relief he seeks or its consequences in 
sufficient detail ” (§4) (pages 829 -830), a claim repeated in Zoubir 20 .  
149. Harbour’s claim remains incor rect but, in any event, I summarise the specific relief 
sought below, which is also provided for in the draft order supplied with the Thomas 
Cross -Application.  
150. I also note that the full relief sought in the draft order provided  by Harbour  with the 
Harbour Application was not fully articulated in the Pre -Action Correspondence . 
(1) Summary of declarations/primary relief sought  
151. In summary, and w ithout prejudice to Mr Thomas’ right to seek additional  or other relief 
in due course, Mr Thomas  presen tly seeks the  following  relief  in the Thomas Cross -
Application : 
151.1.  Declarations that: 
151.1.1.  Clauses 9.1(a) -(e) (or each of them) and Schedule 2  of the Harbour 
IA are unenforceable by Harbour against Mr Thomas (and/or all A1.6/149
 
 
 
 52 funded parties to that contract) . 
151.1.2.  Alternatively, Clause 9.1(e)  and Schedule 2  are unenforceable by 
Harbour against Mr Thomas (and/or all funded parties to that 
contract) .  
151.1.3.  Alternatively , Schedule 2 is unenforceable by Harbour against Mr 
Thomas (and/or all funded parties to that contract) . Mr Thomas 
contends that, in substance, this would produce essentially the same 
result as the declaration in paragraph 151.1.2  above where Clause 
9.1(e) merely incorporates Schedule 2 (if enforceable) into the 
Waterfall.  
151.1.4.  Further or alternatively, Clauses 10.2, 12.1,  and/or 14.4 are 
unenforceable by Harbour against Mr Thomas (and/or all funded 
parties to that contract) .  
151.1.5.  Consequently :  
151.1.5.1.  Harbour has no interest in (and is not entitled to) any 
part of the Proceeds or any payment under or in relation 
to the Harbour IA ; or 
151.1.5.2.  To the extent Harbour is able to save some  but not all  of 
the terms requiring payment to it, Harbour is not entitled  
to any  other sums/payments  under the Harbour IA.  
151.2.  If necessary, a n order  (pursuant to paragraph 27 thereof) varying the  
Consequentials Order as set out below  (or in such other ways or in other respects 
as the Court  sees fit  and/or is necessary to put the declarations listed above into 
legal and practical effect ). This is explained further below.  
152. For obvious reasons, Mr Thomas also resists all of the relief sought by Harbour on the 
Harbour Application.  A1.6/150
 
 
 
 53 (2) Possible i mpact on the Consequentials Order  
153. Mr Thomas has also considered the pote ntial impact of the relief sought in the 
Enforceability Applications on the Consequentials Order.  
154. As a starting point, I note that ( as I say above ): 
154.1.  To the extent the Court considers it necessary to address  the issue, Mr Thomas’ 
application is made pursuant to the ‘liberty to apply’ provision at paragraph 27 
of the Consequentials Order (page 12 ) because  it pertains to the contractual 
documentation underpinning the Harbour Trust and Harbour’s rights and/or 
interests (which are adverse to Mr Thomas’ rights and/or interests) in respect of 
the same which are, in part, the subject of the  Consequentials Order . 
154.2.  It is my understanding that, to date, no assets or funds within the Harbour Trust 
have yet been released to or realised by the Orb Claimants or Harbour pursuant 
to the Harbour IA . 
154.3.  I understand that the assets within the Harbour Trust are currently held  or 
controlled  by t he New Trustees , Joint Liquidators  and/or Enforcement  
Receivers.  
155. Mr Zoubir identifies  in particular paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Consequentials Order  (pages 
6-7) as relevant to the relief sought by Mr Thomas .  
156. Mr Thomas’  primary position is that no amendments are required to the Consequentials 
Order to reflect the declarations sought by Mr Thom as where  (if the d eclarations set out 
above are made)  (i) Harbour can remain  identified  in paragraph 4 of the Consequentials 
Order as a beneficiary of the Harbour Trust but (ii) by reason of the declarations sought, 
is not entitled to any payments thereunder and/or does not have and/or is not entitled to 
vindicate or enforce any rights to as sets within the Harbour Trust.  
157. However, if the Court considers it would be necessary to vary the Consequentials Order 
in the event  the Thomas Cross -Application succeeds in full or in part, I envisage very A1.6/151
 
 
 
 54 limited textual amendments could be made to give effect to the declarations sought.  
158. Specifically, and without prejudice to Mr Thomas’ right to seek further or other 
amendments to the Consequentials Order as appropriate, I currently envisage that the 
following variations/amendments could  be made  to paragraphs 4 -5 ( the single suggested 
deletion  being  shown below in red struck -through text):  
“4. The interests in the following assets are held by their legal owners on the terms of 
the Harbour Trust and are to be applied and apportioned between the beneficiaries, 
namely Harbour,  Orb arl, and Messrs Thomas and Taylor, in accordance with  those 
terms  (save as set out below) ...  
[...] 
5. Any share of the proceeds under the Harbour Trust which is attributable to Orb and 
Messrs Thomas and Taylor shall be adjusted as follows:  
a. The entitlement of Orb and Messrs Thomas and Taylor (after payment out of the 
prior items in the waterfall under the Harbour Trust)16 shall first be determined 
without any adjustments, based on the following percentages: 62.5% to Orb, 
18.75% to Mr Thomas and 18.75% to Mr Taylor; [...] ”.  
159. I do not consider it necessary for the Court to make any further amendments to the 
Consequentials Order  (if indeed it is at all) .  
160. The full relief sought by Mr Thomas is set out in the draft order accompanying the 
Thomas Cross -Application.  
161. For completeness, it is possible that other parties to these and/or related proceedings 
whose interests are engaged by the Consequentials Order or other Orders made by the 
Court concerning Harbour, will wish to make submissions as to any other impacts on o r 
appropriate variations to the Consequentials Order or other Orders in light of the 
 
16 These words in parentheses  could be deleted in the event  all of  Clauses 9.1(a) -(e) (plus Schedule 2)  are held 
unenforceable  – such that the only distribution which falls to be made as part of Clause 9.1 is pursuant to Clause 
9.1(f)  – and the Court considers it necessary or desirable to do so . A1.6/152
 
 
 
 55 declarations and findings which Mr Thomas asks the Court to make. I am not presently 
aware that any party currently wishes to do so  and Mr Thomas’ rights are fully reserved 
in relation to the same.  
(3) Counter -relief sought by Harbour  
162. Finally,  and for the record , I note that, upon issuing its application, Harbour has provided 
Mr Thomas with a proposed draft order  setting out the full relief it seeks , together with 
unusual and extreme  provisions  such as  (for example)  (i) the “ totally without merit ” 
marker/declaration  (§2), and (ii)  the asymmetrical “ liberty to apply ” provision in favour 
only of the Settlement Parties (as defined) and excluding Mr Thomas  (§7). Zoubir 20 
does not even attempt to justify these ancillary provisions.  
163. The relief sought by Harbour  in its draft order  is resisted  by Mr Thomas  in its totality.  
Mr Thomas reserves the right to make observations and raise objections as to the  nature 
and/or form of the  relief sought  therein  if and to the extent it becomes necessary in due 
course.  
STATEMENT OF TRUTH  
 
I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true. I understand that proceedings 
for contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes, or causes to be made, a false 
statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.
