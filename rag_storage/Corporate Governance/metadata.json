This is my 20thth witness statement in this action (the \u201c Proceedings \u201d) and is made following the conclusion of the trial pursuant to which Mr Justice Foxton rendered his judgment on 18 May 2021 (the \u201c Directed Trial Judgment \u201d)1 and subsequent Consequentials Order dated 11 June 2021 (the \u201cConsequentials Order \u201d) (pages 1-20). 1 The Serious Fraud Office & Anor v Litigation Capital Ltd & Ors [2021] EWHC 1272 (Comm) (18 May 2021) (bailii.org) A1.5/17 2 2 Insofar as the contents of this witness statement are within my own knowledge they are true and , insofar as they are based on things I have read or which have been told to me by others, they are true to the best of my information and belief (the source of such information and belief being identified below). 3 Nothing I say in this witness statement constitutes, or is intended to constitute, a waiver of Harbour\u2019s legal professional privilege or that of the Settlement Parties (as hereinafter defined) . 4 There is now shown to me a bundle of paginated documents marked AKZ -20 containing true cop ies of the documents to which I refer herein. 5 I make this statement in support of Harbour\u2019s application for various relief as set out in draft order provided with the application. In summary, Harbour seeks : 5.1 An order or declaration to the effect that Dr Cochrane is not permitted to seek to challenge the outcome of the Directed Trial (to include the Court\u2019s findings in relation to the ownership of Orb, and its conclusions concerning Harbour\u2019s entitlements based on its Investment Agreement), by reason of her signing the LCL Settlement Agreement as well as a deed dated 23 October 20142 (the \u201c 2014 Harbour Deed \u201d) (pages 21 \u2013 31) (addressed further below); 5.2 An order or declaration to the effect that any attempt now made (whether by Dr Cochrane, Mr Thomas or anyone else) to raise arguments challenging Harbour\u2019s entitlements as found in the Directed Trial, or otherwise seeking to disturb the outcome of the Directed Trial, is an abuse of process or otherwise barred by doctrines of estoppel or similar principles , or is time barred , including (in the case of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas ) estoppe l by the terms of the Harbour Deed ); 5.3 An order or declaration rejecting any argument to the effect that the Harbour IA is unenforceable by reason of the decision of the Supreme Court in R (on the application of PACCAR Inc and others (Appellants) v Competition Appeal Tribunal and others (Respondents) [2023] UKSC 28",

While Mr Thomas has often corresponded with Harbour and the other Settlement Parties on behalf of himself and Mr Taylor , I understand that Mr Taylor may no longer be involved in this matter on a day to day basis.

As such, Harbour has sought a stay of the Jersey Recall Application s pending the determination of this Application5. 13 In response to its stay application , pursuant to a hearing on 25 June 2024 the Royal Court of Jersey directed Harbour to inter alia produce to it a draft of th is Application by 2 August 2024, which it did. A hearing is listed on 12 November 2024 before the Jersey Court to determine Harbour\u2019s stay application , but in the meantime Harbour considers it appropriate to proceed as intended, now that its interactions with Mr Thomas (set out below) appear to have reached their natural conclusion in terms of their usefulness . 14 In addition to (and I believe in connection with) the Jersey Recall Applications, on 11 July 2024 Harbour received a letter before action from Marriot Harrison LLP, instructed by Mr Thomas (the \u201c Thomas Letter Before Action \u201d) (pages 87-106). According to the Thomas Letter Before Action , Mr Thomas now intends to challenge the validity of the Harbour IA in the English Courts, on the basis of the PACCAR Decision. 15 Correspondence has passed between Marriott Harrison and my firm since my firm\u2019s receipt of the Thomas Letter Before Action (pages 107-145), regarding appropriate pre - action steps and the applicability of the 31 March 2023 Order of Foxton J , which required Messrs Thomas and Taylor to provide evidence regarding their source of funding for any 4 Paragraph 7 of Dr Cochrane\u2019s A mended Representation (page 978) 5 Harbour had originally intended to seek a stay in reliance upon the passage through Parliament of the Litigation Funding (Enforceability) Bill, which had been expected to pass into law this year and cure with retrospective effect any PACCAR issues, but did not as a result of the calling of the election on 4 July 2024.

The cooperation between M r Thomas and Dr Cochrane (doubtless both under the direction of and in conjunction with Dr Smith) is apparent both from this reference and the Thomas Letter Before Action , which expressly refers to the Jersey Recall Applications , notwithstanding the fact that he is not ostensibly involved in th e Jersey proceedings .6 17 As indicated above, m y firm has exchanged correspond ence with Marriott Harrison with a view to narrowing the issues between our respective clients . This has included our provi sion to them of a draft of this application as filed with the Jersey Court on 2 August 2024 (including a draft of this witness statement, albeit that it has since been further developed in some respects ). Despite this, it has unfortunately not been possible for the parties to narrow their differences , with the parties\u2019 positions being diametrically opposed . As part of this correspondence , we have repeatedly invited Mr Thomas to set out in detail the consequences of the relief he intends to seek \u2013 in other words \u2013 what the effect would be on the findings made in the Directed Trial Judgment as reflected in the Consequentials Order of an order declaring the Harbour IA to be unenforceable . This is an important point in circumstances where Mr Thomas\u2019 own case at the Directed Trial was advanced on the basis of proprietary rights he asserted as having arise n under the Harbour Trust , and he advanced no alternative proprietary claim. In their letter dated 25 September 2024, Marriott Harrison have said that the effect of their client\u2019s application succeeding would be that Harbour would not be entitled to any part of the assets listed in paragraph 4 of the Consequential s Order and their beneficial owners would be the Orb Claimants. No 6 I note that in an affidavit served by Dr Cochrane on 24 September 2024 in support of the Jersey Recall Applications, Dr Cochrane stated \u201cwhile I am aware of other proceedings being taken in respect of the illegality issue and other matters, I am not acting in concert with any others \u201d. Unfortunately, given my and my client\u2019s extensive experience in these proceedings, I do not accept that either this Court or the Jersey Court can take this suggestion at face value . A1.5/21 6 detailed analysis has been provi ded of how this alleged beneficial interest arises or its interaction with third party proprietary claims advanced at the Directed Trial . 18 Mr Thomas has also sought to argue that the terms of the Debarring /Stay Directions did not reflect the Court\u2019s ruling of 31 March 2023 and has sought to question the way in which the draft order was finalised, despite having been copied on all relevant correspondence with the Court regarding the same , and his comments on the draft having been provided to the Court . In particular, he suggests via Marriott Harrison that the Court\u2019s only intenti on was that he should be required to pay outstanding costs orders in order",

In particular, he suggests via Marriott Harrison that the Court\u2019s only intenti on was that he should be required to pay outstanding costs orders in order to pursue any claim or application against the Settlement Parties. 19 In terms of the position in relation to the outstanding costs orders, Mr Thomas has settled the outstanding costs payments to Harbour due under paragraph 25 of the costs Order of 21 October 2021 , paragraph 3 of the costs order of 8 July 20227and paragraph 8 of the costs order of 24 March 2023. The final costs order was settled by Mr Thomas on 22 October 2024. 20 However, Harbour considers it to be clear that , given the content of Harbour\u2019s application for a debarring order and the Court\u2019s previous experience of Mr Thomas\u2019 conduct in the Part 8 Proceedings and the revelations as to the funding of that matter , the Court i ntended what its order requires, i.e. that Mr Thomas should also provide evidence of both (a) the source of funding for any further claim or application and (b) the involvement of Dr Smith and Mr McNally , or any persons Mr Thomas knows the be associated with them . The Debarring/Stay Directions accordingly accurately reflect the Court\u2019s intention . Harbour\u2019s position, which m y firm has conveyed to Mr Thomas \u2019s solicitors is that the terms of the Debarring/Stay Directions will apply in the event that Mr Thomas files his threatened 7 My understanding, derived from discussions with Stewarts (privilege in relation to which is not waived) is that Messrs Thomas and Taylor were able to make this payment pursuant to a settlement reached with St Paul \u2019s Solicitors (in liquidation) (\u201cSt Paul \u2019s\u201d), a firm instructed by them on various occasions in these proceedings , and previous ly run by Mr Andrew Crossley . My understanding is that on 16 May 2023, Messrs Thomas and Taylor filed a professional negligence claim against St Pauls (the \u201c St Paul\u2019s Claim \u201d), due to the failure by St Paul \u2019s to serve the particulars of claim in separate proceedings against Stewarts which were consequently dismissed by the court . Ultimately, St Paul \u2019s insurer settled the claim . In the interim, as the Court is aware, Stewarts Law filed a third party debt order application (\u201cTPDO Application \u201d) in respect of the settlement monies . On 9 July 2024 , the TPDO Application was dismissed by consent , on terms that provided for (inter alia) significant payments to the funder and ATE providers in respect of Messrs Thomas and Taylor \u2019s negligence claim, a firm of solicitors, as well as payments in respect of Messrs Thomas and Taylor\u2019s outstanding costs obligations. The relevant consent order (\u201c TPDO Consent Order \u201d) is at pages 157 - 159. While I am not aware of the full background to the St Paul \u2019s Claim, I note that St Paul\u2019s appear s to have accepted that it breached the duties it owed to Messrs Thomas and Taylor relatively soon after the negligence action was commenced . Mr Crossley is currently a consultant at another firm, Taylor Rose . I understand that while at Tay lor Rose, Mr Crossley acted for Ms Dawna Stickler in matters related to these proceedings.

A1.5/22 7 application first, makes a cross -application in response to this Application, or otherwise seeks any relief in response to Harbour\u2019s Application . 21 Accordingly, r egardless of whether Mr Thomas has satisfied the costs orders referred to above , it remains Harbour\u2019s position that Mr Thomas must satisfy the remaining provisions of the Debarring/Stay Directions before he is able actively to do anything else. The Debarring/Stay Directions were made in light of Mr Thomas\u2019s repeated efforts to obstruct the Settlement Parties \u2019 efforts to enforce their rights pursuant to the Directed Trial, with support and funding provided by Dr Smith and his associates , and ul timately in those parties\u2019 interests . 22 In light of all of the above , Harbour seeks, by this Application, to achieve a (further) confirmation of finality in terms of the status of the Directed Trial Judgment and related orders and the Harbour IA , such that the Smith Parties are precluded , to the greatest extent possible, from continuing to interfere with the judicial findings of this Court with the result that the realisation process can continue unimpeded . Harbour is aware that to the extent that it is required to go beyond questions of whether Mr Thomas or Dr Cochrane are shut out from re -opening argument, this Application may engage the interests of other parties to the se proceedings . Given the lack of clarity provided by Mar riott Harrison in respect of Mr Thomas\u2019s intended course of action, other parties may argue that, should Mr Thomas succeed, this could potentially re -engage those other parties\u2019 interests in the assets which were the subject of the Directed Trial. 23 As such, if Mr Thomas complies with all the provisions of the Debarring/Stay Directions and this Application is subsequently opposed by Mr Thomas, these type of extremely complex follow -on issues (as well as alternative arguments potentially available to Harbour to sustain its rights) mean that the overriding objective is likely to be best served by case managing issues of principle to be resolved at a first stage, and only if: (a) arguments based on the PACCAR Decision are open to Mr Thomas (and Dr Cochran e); and (b) are successful, to then convene a second stage which can take account of these broader questions . Harbour intends to make more detailed case management proposals in this regard once the initial round of evidence has been exchanged in response to this Application. 24 I should note that Harbour presents this application to this Court, because this Court has substantial familiarity with the underlying history and plainly has an interest in seeing its A1.5/23 8 existing findings and conclusions respected. In addition, the agreements that are the subject of the relevant disputes are governed by English law and contain jurisdiction clauses in favour of the English Courts. It appears, from the Thomas Letter Before Action , that Mr Thomas also envisages bringing his challenge before this Court. However , I note for completeness that the Court\u2019s view may be that although the English Courts are competent and best placed to hear these issues, some of the arguments being co ntemplated",

However , I note for completeness that the Court\u2019s view may be that although the English Courts are competent and best placed to hear these issues, some of the arguments being co ntemplated by Mr Thomas can only be (or are most appropriately) pursued by way of application for permission to appeal the outcome of the Directed Trial to the Court of Appeal , albeit long out of time , rather than to the first instance Court . 25 Indeed, I note in this regard that on 28 September 2023, Mr Thomas wrote to Harbour (on an open basis) enclosing a draft appellant\u2019s notice . Mr Thomas stated in the accompanying letter (marked \u201cUrgent and Immediate \u201d) that his intention was to \u201cappeal against the Directed Trial Judgement of Foxton J. (in particular various terms of the 11 June Consequentials Order, the 14 December 2022 Tru st and Receivership Orders, and the 31 March 2023 Directions (Debarring/Stay application order) \u201d (pages 160-172). Mr Thom as acknowledged that the proposed appeal was out of time, and sought Harbour\u2019s consent to its terms . 26 My firm responded on 29 September 2023 , noting that Mr Thomas\u2019s letter was not accompan ied by grounds of appeal , skeleton argument, any evidence in support o r draft orders (pages 173-174). In fact , it set out no grounds at all for the proposed appeal. Our email stated that we would consider the substance of the application when such materials were provided. Mr Thomas provided no such further materials . 27 I note that Mr Thomas , nine months after his intimated appeal to the Court of Appeal , appears to have decided to take a different approach , instead propos ing to ap ply to th is Court . 28 At this point, as noted above, the precise form of relief sought by Mr Thomas is not entirely clear. The Thomas Letter Before Action concludes that Harbour is \u201c not entitled to any sums from the Proceeds pursuant to the Harbour IA and all of the assets held pursuant to the Harbour Trust are to be released to the funded parties in their appropriate proportions .\u201d and that \u201cAppropriate consequential steps will follow in respect of the assets currently held pursuant to the Harbour Trust, which we would also seek to agree with you without the need for litigation .\u201d. When my firm p ressed for further details of Mr Thomas\u2019s intended relief, Marriott Harrison responded that : A1.5/24 9 \u201c1. It is perfectly clear that if our client succeeds in demonstrating that the Harbour IA (or any specific DBA part of it) is unenforceable: (i) Harbour will not be entitled to any part of the assets listed in paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order (and we note that you do not argue to the contrary); and (ii) their beneficial owners would be the Orb Claimants (in their appropriate proportions) as the claimants in the claim of which these assets are the proceeds. \u201d 29 It is therefore not entirely clear what the appropriate procedural route for such relief sought by Mr Thomas might be , and it is obviously an incomplete analysis, because if Mr Thomas\u2019 rights under the Harbour IA (which were themselves established at the Directed Trial) fall away, he does not articulate how he would nevertheless establish",

Despite this, and w hilst it will be a matter primarily for submissions , I would respectfully suggest that at least some of the reli ef sought by way of this Application can properly be sought from the first instance Court \u2013 by way of example, this Court can rule on the request for relief concerning Dr Cochrane and the LCL Settlement Agreement (which we expand upon at paragraph 84-97 below) , and this Court can also, for example, confirm the present validity of its existing findings so far as it is concerned \u2013 without trespassing on any matters which might fall within the appellate jurisdiction. Further, the time for pursuing any appeal o f the Directed Trial outcome has long since passed, and indeed the PACCAR Decision is no longer recent (having been handed down over a year ago) , such that it is very difficult to see on what basis any prospective appellant could seek permission to appeal out of time from the Court of Appeal in any event . 30 It is also not clear what Mr Taylor\u2019s position is on Mr Thomas\u2019s intended relief, or whether he is even aware of this matter. Harbour will serve a copy of this Application on Mr Taylor and invite him to confirm his position in advance of any hearing. 31 Harbour\u2019s position in respect of the relief sought by Mr Thomas is necessarily reserved, pending compliance with the Debarring/ Stay Directions and clarification of the precise approach taken by him in this litigation, and the basis for that approach. However, Harbour does invite this Court to make such orders as are within its jurisdiction to confirm the final nature of the findings and orders it has made, so as to deal as fully as possible with the recent challenges which have been intimated. B. Executive Summary of the basis of the relief sought by Harbour A1.5/25 10 32 In accordance with its obligations under the Harbour IA, Harbour provided nearly \u00a35.2 million of funding to the Orb Claimants, in order for them to pursue claims against Mr Andrew Ruhan and others in proceedings numbered CL-2012 -000625 (the \u201c Orb Litigation \u201d). I will address further below the mechanism by which Harbour\u2019s entitlement to a return on its investment is calculated . However , it is also relevant to note here that Harbour\u2019s entitlements were secured by: 32.1 a debenture giving Harbour fixed and floating charges over the whole, or substantially the whole, of Orb\u2019s property; and 32.2 a guarantee from Dr Cochrane which was in turn secured by a security interest agreement over the shares in Orb. 33 As this Court knows , the Harbour IA is governed by the law of England and Wales (as are the other transaction documents) . 34 Harbour\u2019s position, in summary, is that there is no basis for disturbing the outcome of t he Directed Trial , to include the Consequentials Order .

      "text": ", the Harbour IA is governed by the law of England and Wales (as are the other transaction documents) . 34 Harbour\u2019s position, in summary, is that there is no basis for disturbing the outcome of t he Directed Trial , to include the Consequentials Order . It is too late for any such attempt to be made now to this Court, and i t would be an abuse of process for the Dr Cochrane, or Messrs Thomas and Taylor (or any other party) to argue otherwise. Moreover, (a) so far as Dr Cochrane is concerned, she has signed a Deed by which she has expressly agreed not to pursue such points ; and (b) so far as both Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas are concerned, they signed the 2014 Harbour Deed by which they agreed that the recoveries under the IOM Settlement were to be treated as \u201cProceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings\u201d for the purposes of Cl 9.1 of the Harbour IA an d were to be applied in accordance with the terms of that clause . 35 Further, to the extent that Mr Thomas or others seek to rely on the PACCAR Decisio n, and to the extent this Court is prepared to entertain such arguments at all, its effect was not to make new law regarding whether or not litigation funding agreements , such as the Harbour IA , were Damages Based Agreements (a \u201cDBA \u201d or collectively \u201c DBAs \u201d), subject to the terms of the DBA Regulations 2013 (\u201cthe DBA Regulations \u201d). The argument that the Harbour IA is a DBA has been available to the Orb Claimants since the agree ment was first entered into and the possibility that the funding arrangements such as the Harbour IA were in fact subject to the DBA Regulations ha s been publicly debated in legal, academic and political circles since at least 201 4. A1.5/26 11 36 I will set out further below the extensive opportunities that the Orb Claimants have had prior to and during the Directed Trial to seek to run the arguments that Dr Cochrane now advances in the Jersey Recall Application s, and that Mr Thomas has threatened in the Thomas Letter Before Action . Harbour\u2019s position is that the arguments advanced by both Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas (as well as any argument that she or others may advance in opposition to Harbour\u2019s present application), constitute an abuse of process. In the alternative, if that is not the case, they are time barred. 37 Further , and to the extent necessary , Harbour also contends that in any event, the PACCAR Decision, even on its merits, does not render the Harbour IA unenforceable, or that if it does so to some extent, that it is only unenforceable in part . Again, Harbour\u2019s arguments will be further developed in its submissions, but a summary of the key points advanced, and the evidence upon which they are based, is set out below . 38 The remainder of this witness statement is accordingly divided into the following sections : 38.1 The outcome of the Directed Trial as regards Harbour and the Orb Claimants (Section C) ; 38.2 The Smith Parties\u2019 actions since the Directed Trial (Section D) ; 38.3 The Actions of Dr Cochrane specifically (Section E) ; 38.4 The PACCAR decision and its relevance to the Harbour IA (Section F) ; 38.5 The LCL Settlement Agreement and the 2014 Harbour Deed (Section G) ; 38.6 The abusive nature of the Smith Parties\u2019 attempt to seek to invalidate the Harbour",

A1.5/27 12 C. The outcome of the Directed Trial as regards Harbour and the Orb Claimants 39 Given the Court\u2019s familiarity with the Directed Trial, I will not rehearse the extensive background here. By way of summary only, I set out below the salient facts insofar as this Application is concerned. 40 The Directed Trial in these proceedings commenced on 19 January 2021. Shortly thereafter and just before Dr Smith was due to give evidence , on 27 January 2021, the Smith Parties (including Dr Smith and Dr Cochrane, but not including Messrs Thomas and Taylor) entered into a settlement agreement (the \u201c LCL Settlement Agreement \u201d) (pages 175- 337) with Harbour, the Serious Fraud Office (\u201c SFO \u201d), Stewarts Law LLP (\u201c Stewarts \u201d), the liquidators of a group of BVI companies (the \u201c Joint Liquidators \u201d), the Viscount of the Royal Court of Jersey in her capacity as the administrator of the en d\u00e9sastres of Dr Cochrane and Orb (the \u201c Viscount \u201d), and the Receivers of the realisable property of Dr Smith (the \u201c Enforcement Receivers \u201d, together the \u201c Settlement Parties \u201d). The Smith Parties (known in the LCL Settlement Agreement as the LCL Parties) provided undertakings to the Court to assist the Settlement Parties (recorded in an order made on 4 February 2021 (the \u201c LCL Discontinuance Order \u201d)) (pages 338-348) and discontinued their claims , taking no further part in the Directed Trial. 41 On 16 May 2021, the Directed Trial Judgment was handed down. All of the claims advanced by Harbour and the other Settlement Parties succeeded in all material respects. 42 In respect of Orb and Dr Cochrane, the Judge made the following findings: 42.1 The shares of Orb were found to be the realisable property of Dr Smith, further to a Confiscation Order obtained by the SFO on 13 November 2007 in the sum of \u00a340,856,9118 (the \u201c Confiscation Order \u201d). 42.2 More generally, the judge found that Dr Cochrane held the shares in the Non - Arena Companies (including Orb), for Dr Smith, as his nominee. 42.3 Separately, the Judge found that 50% of Bodega (the company which owns Steephill, the property in Jersey in which Dr Cochrane resides) was held by its legal owner (Dr Cochrane) on the terms of the Harbour Trust in respect of which the Judge subsequently, on 14 December 2022, appointed receivers on the application 8 I understand that the current balance of the Confiscation Order, including interest, is around \u00a382 million.

The Judge ordered the following in respect of Harbour\u2019s and the Orb Claimants\u2019 entitlement: \u201c4. The interests in the following assets are held by their legal owners on the terms of the Harbour Trust and are to be applied and apportioned between the beneficiaries, namely Harbour, Orb arl, and Messrs Thomas and Taylor, in accordance with those term s (save as set out below): a. The shares in the Arena Companies (as set out in Schedule 2 to this order); b. Such future distributions as may be paid or payable to the shareholders of the Arena Companies; c. The traceable proceeds of the IOM Settlement Cash, but in particular: i. An equitable interest of 100% in Flat 24 Hamilton House; ii. An equitable interest in 50% of the shares in Bodega; iii.

An equitable interest of 90% in Flat 12 Hamilton House (reflecting the balance of the purchase price); ii. An equitable interest of 88.05% in Montagu Square (reflecting the balance of the purchase price); subject to such claims as remain available to Mr Pelz following the findings in the Trial Judgment as set out below at paragraph [23] (for the avoidance of doubt, this qualification applies only to the assets listed at items 2.d.i and ii above). 5. Any share of the proceeds under the Harbour Trust which is attributable to Orb and Messrs Thomas and Taylor shall be adjusted as follows: a. The entitlement of Orb and Messrs Thomas and Taylor (after payment out of the prior items in the waterfall under the Harbour Trust) shall first be determined without any adjustments, based on the following percentages: 62.5% to Orb, 18.75% to Mr Thomas and 18.75% to Mr Taylor; b. Thereafter: i. Mr Thomas is required to give credit in the sum of \u00a31,010,097.75 and his entitlement shall be reduced accordingly; ii. Mr Taylor is required to give credit in the sum of \u00a31,546,998 and his entitlement shall be reduced accordingly. c. For the avoidance of doubt, no payment shall be made in respect of the adjusted shares until after the amounts secured by the Stewarts lien set out in paragraph [8] have been fully satisfied.\u201d 44 In respect of the Viscount\u2019s entitlement, the Judge ordered the following: \u201c14.

With the exception of the shares in Bodega, Dr Gerald Martin Smith holds 100% of the equitable interest in the shares of each of the Non Arena Companies (as set out in Schedule 2 to this order). 17. To the extent that the whole equitable interest in Flat 1 Hamilton House is not exhausted by the equitable interests of the beneficiaries under the Harbour Trust and the companies under the Joint Liquidators\u2019 control respectively, the balance of the eq uitable interest is attributable to Dr Gerald Martin Smith. 18. All of the shares in Litigation Capital Limited are held in the name of Conduit Asset Management Limited for Anthony Smith, who in turn holds them as a nominee for Dr Gerald Martin Smith, who thereby holds a 100% equitable interest in the said shares. 19. Save as otherwise provided for by the declarations in this order any and all residuary equitable interests in the Relevant Property and IUAs are held either by the Viscount of the Royal Court of Jersey, in her capacity as the administrator of the en d\u00e9 sastre (bankruptcy) proceedings of Dr Cochrane, or by Dr Gerald Martin Smith.\u201d 46 The most immediately relevant aspect of the Directed Trial findings in respect of the SFO is that Orb (a Non -Arena Company) is the realisable property of Dr Smith and therefore subject to the SFO\u2019s Confiscation Order , per paragraph 16 of the Consequentials Order. While I understand that Dr Cochrane remains the nominal legal shareholder of Orb, the Consequentials Order is unequivocal : she has no right to Orb or its assets. A1.5/31 16 47 Dr Cochrane sought, by an application of 10 January 2024 of which I provide further details below, to remove Orb from the list of Non -Arena companies in the Consequentials Order, and her application was dismissed and certified as being \u201c totally without merit \u201d. As such, Dr Cochrane has identified no basis for disturbing paragraph 16 of the Consequentials Order. 48 It is particularly notable that Dr Cochrane\u2019s Jersey Recall Applications , and in particular the exercise she proposes in order to assess her personal financial position are premised in large part on an account of Orb\u2019s assets , which she assert ed (wrongly) were to be treated as her own .

In her third affidavit of 11 March 2024 , Dr Cochrane also initially claimed to \u201cown 100% of the shares of Orb\u201d (pages 349 \u2013 365), and omitted to inform the Jersey Court of the full effect of the Directed Trial\u2019s finding that Orb\u2019s shares constituted the realisable property of Dr Smith. At the hearing of 26 June 2024 , the Jersey Court indicated its disapproval of Dr Cochrane\u2019s failure to e xplain the findings as to Orb in the Directed Trial Judgment given that she was subject t o a duty of full and frank disclosure when seeking permission to serve the Recall Application out of the jurisdiction , and required Dr Cochrane to explain her omission . As I note further below, Dr Cochrane has since amended her position in relation to the shares of Orb. D. The Smith Parties\u2019 actions since the Directed Trial 49 As indicated above, the Smith Parties have by various means sought to frustrate the outcome of the Directed Trial Judgment and related orders. Given the many separate instances, these , with the exception of Dr Cochrane\u2019s activities in Jersey given the recen t nature of the Jersey Recall Applications, are only summarised in this witness statement. Appendix 1 to this statement contains a more detailed record of the activities in question9. 50 The disruptive actions , unlawful conduct and court proceedings issued or necessitated include: 50.1 Resistance on the part of Dr Cochrane of the steps taken by the Enforcement Receivers regarding the control of Casa Coloniches (a Non -Arena Company) ; 9 Appendix 1 cross -refers to official reports provided by the Enforcement Receivers , in accordance with the terms of the Variation Order dated 7 December 2017 (which I refer to by the prefix \u201cMR \u201d) and the Receivership Order date d 14 De cember 2022 . They are restricted to a circulation list which includes Harbour, the Viscount and Mr Thomas, but are otherwise confidential. The Enforcement Receivers have confirmed that these documents may , in redacted form, be referred to for the purp oses of this application. Redactions have been applied in respect of commercially sensitive information.

This led to the Debarring/Stay Directions (pages 382-384); 50.10 Proceedings involving Mr Sodzawiczny before the Isle of Man courts, which culminated in Mr Thomas and a Mr Miah (who had been involved in the activities referred to at paragraph 50.8 above ) being found to be in contempt of court as a result of their failure to remove a company director whose actions were in breach of an injunction protecting Mr Sodzawiczny\u2019s interests in property in Spain ; A1.5/33 18 50.11 Prolonged o bstruction of the Enforcement Receivers by Dr Cochrane and other Dr Smith associates10 in respect of C\u2019an Agata and Son Montserrat (the \u201cSpanish Properties \u201d); 50.12 Dr Smith and Dr Cochrane purporting to commence an LCIA Arbitration resulting in Mr Sodzawiczny needing to seek and obtaining an anti -arbitration injunction; 50.13 The Slip Rule Application; 50.14 Mr Thomas\u2019s threatened claim against Harbour in respect of his purported rights under the Harbour IA to require H arbour to indemn ify him for his own outstanding costs obligations (pages 3 88 \u2013 389)11; 50.15 Dr Smith being convicted of fraud on 29 July 2024 in relation to fraudulently obtaining COVID -19 Bounce Back Loans , and subsequently on 20 September 2024 sentenced to 18 months imprisonment12.

I would respectfully suggest that t he challenges which they have mounted in re liance upon the PACCAR Decision should be considered in that context ; namely, that arguments over enforceability of the Harbour IA are merely the latest means by which these parties seek to undermine decisions of this court with which Dr Smith and others do not agree.

A1.5/35 20 54 In a letter dated 11 April 2023 (pages 439-448) Dr Cochrane alleged breaches by Harbour of the Harbour IA, a conspiracy against the Orb Claimants by Harbour and the Settlement Parties, and that (directly contrary to the findings of the Directed Tr ial) she was personal ly entitle d to the assets of Orb. Specifically, her letter stated : \u201cby failing to honour [Harbour\u2019s] agreements terms [they] prevented us from obtaining additional litigation funding\u2026this was [Harbour\u2019s] first repudiatory breach\u201d. \u201cthe [2019 Settlement Agreement] sets outs out the mechanics of [Harbour\u2019s] conspiracy against the Orb Claimants\u201d \u201cThe Orb claimants won [the Directed Trial]. The so called settling parties have not. And yet you have over the last 2 years, as \u201cLead\u201d conspired to prevent the Harbour Trust from coming into functional being in fundamental breach of your own Harbour IA te rms\u201d. \u201cThe monies recovered by the Orb Claimants belong to them pursuant to the terms of the Harbour IA trust arrangements. I, as the 100% owner of Orb, want it to receive what it is entitled to.\u201d 55 My firm responded to these accusations on 11 May 2023 (pages 452-454): 55.1 confirming that Harbour emphatically den ied any impropriety or breach of any obligations , or that it has caused Dr Cochrane any loss; 55.2 Reiterating the position on Orb\u2019s ownership, referring to the Directed Trial judgment whereby it was held that, notwithstanding Dr Cochrane being the registered shareholder, the shares held in Orb were held as nominee for Dr Smith and therefore, recoverable by the SFO ; and 55.3 Indicating to Dr Cochrane that her correspondence appeared to be a \u201c coordinated attempt by [her], Mr Thomas and Dr Smith to further frustrate the outcome of the Directed Trial\u201d . 56 It is clear to me that from at least April 2023, Dr Cochrane\u2019s intention was to gain control of the assets of the Harbour Trust, as well as the assets of Orb. This is the position she maintains now , albeit premised on the alleged unenforceability of the Harbour IA, rather than the previous allegations of (presumably repudiatory) breache s of the Harbour IA by A1.5/36 21 Harbour. However, as the Court will note, this chain of communications was commenced by Dr Cochrane before the PACCAR Decision was handed down . 57 Following the PACCAR Decision , Dr Cochrane re -commenced correspondence with Harbour, now seeking its agreement to an application to set aside or annul her d\u00e9sastre , and that of Orb, on the ground that they were obtained by Harbour in circumstances where the Harbour IA was an unlawful and/or unenforceable agreement. 58 On numerous occasions during this period, Harbour set out its position to Dr Cochrane in correspondence. By way of example, in a letter of 10 August 2023 (pages 452-453), my firm responded to Dr Cochrane as follows: \u201c5. As to paragraph 7 of your letter, Harbour\u2019s position is as follows: a) The orders made in and in relation to the SFO Proceedings numbered CL -2017- 000323 including the Directed Trial Consequentials Order and the 14 December 2022 Trust and Receivership Order remain valid, binding and enforceable and Harbour will naturally a bide by their terms. b) No party sought to challenge the enforceability of the Investment Agreement at the Directed Trial despite having had the opportunity to do so. Any attempt to do so now would constitute an abuse of the court\u2019s process. c) Your suggestion that the Investment Agreement \u201cwas unlawful from its signature and is unenforceable\u201d is legally misconceived,",

Manipulation that has been ongoing for almost 7 years \u201d (pages 457-458). The letter, as well as a letter dated 16 August 2023 (pages 459-460), sought to obtain their consent to support Dr Cochrane\u2019s application to \u201cset aside/ annul\u201d the d\u00e9sastre orders. 60 On 21 August 2023, Dr Cochrane again accused Harbour of \u201c an evolving conspiracy that repetitively breached the Harbour IA terms \u201d, alleging that Harbour \u201c victimised \u201d the funded parties (pages 461- 463). 61 In a letter dated 25 August 2023, Dr Cochrane assert ed that she intended to seek \u201c\u2026compensatory and or restitutionary damages. Be that through the Courts of Jersey, the Privy Counsel A1.5/37 22 [sic], the English High Court or the courts of the Cayman Islands or the USA \u201d. In the same letter, Dr Cochrane again allege d that Harbour has \u201c deliberately and with malice and forethought [sic], unlawfully damaged and impacted my family\u2019s and my life and the Orb Claimants rights \u201d (pages 464- 465). 62 On 23 October 2023, Dr Cochrane made another request for Harbour to agree to a consent order in support of her set aside application (pages 466-467). On the same day, our firm responded, repeating Harbour\u2019s position that her assertion as to the supposed \u201cmistake\u201d in the drafting of the Consequentials Order was \u201cbaseless and inaccurate\u201d (pages 468-469). 63 Materially similar allegations were made by Dr Cochrane on the next day, 24 October 2023, in relation to the composition of the Non -Arena companies and Orb\u2019s ownership in direct conflict with the Directed Trial Judgment and Consequentials Order, as well as against Harbour of \u201c serial (and most probably repudiatory breaches) of its own agreements terms \u201d (pages 470- 474). The Slip Rule Application 64 Notwithstanding this firm having set out Harbour\u2019s position on the matter in correspondence , Dr Cochrane ultimately filed an application on 10 January 2024 to amend the Consequentials Order purportedly under the \u2018Slip Rule\u2019 to remove Orb from the list of Non -Arena Companies, on the basis that it had been included by mistake when the order was drafted (the \u201c Slip Rule Application \u201d) (pages 475-487). 65 On 15 January 2024, my firm filed written submissions in response to the Slip Rule Application (pages 488-494), arguing that the application should be dismissed for the following reasons: 65.1 Dr Cochrane did not have standing to bring this application, on the basis that she remains subject to d\u00e9sastre in Jersey and is represented by the Viscount; 65.2 The application was without merit ; and 65.3 The application was made by and/or with the support of Dr Smith and his associates, with the aim of frustrating court judgments and orders.

All of the previous correspondence purportedly sent by Dr Cochrane bear s the distinctive hallmarks of Dr Smith \u2019s letter -writing style . Further, Harbour \u2019s submissions referred to a letter of 2 January 2024 which purports to have been sent by Dr A1.5/38 23 Cochrane and Mr Thomas to Susan Dunn of Harbour, Mr Jackson of Quantuma (one of the Joint Liquidators) as well as the managing partner of Stewarts Law, Mr Dench, containing allegations of conspiracy by Harbour, the Joint Liquidators and Stewarts against the Orb Claimants. The metadata on this letter showed that it was drafted by Dr Smith (who is listed as the \u2018author\u2019), rather than by Dr Cochrane. 66 On 17 January 2024, Dr Cochrane responded to Harbour\u2019s submissions by asserting that: \u201c\u2026the Directed Trial did not determine that my ownership of Orb arl was as a nominee for Dr Gerald Smith as paragraph 1 of the Consequentials Order makes clear \u201d (paragraph 4) (pages 495-500). 67 On the same day, Dr Cochrane wrote to the Viscount\u2019s Jersey lawyers, Ogier (pages 501- 503). In particular, she wrote that : \u201cI understand from that advice that at the convening hearing the Royal Court will be asked to make substantive decisions as to whether certain claimants who have filed claims in my d\u00e9sastre process and the d\u00e9sastre process of Orb a.r.l (Orb) are properly t o be treated as creditors. It would be unreasonable to ask the Royal Court to undertake the process of reviewing all the claims with respect to Orb if it is a Non -Arena company.\u201d 68 Shortly thereafter, on 22 January 2024 , Foxton J dismissed the Slip Rule Application on the papers, on the basis that D r Cochrane had no standing , and certified the application itself as being \u201c totally without merit\u201d (\u201cthe Slip Rule Application Ruling \u201d) (pages 504- 505). In his ruling, Foxton J highlighted (inter alia) the following relevant passages of the Directed Trial Judgment (with emphasis added ): \u201c606. Subject to (a) my finding as to the Retained 50% in Bodega (at [503(iv)] above) and (b) any issues which arise as to the effect of the Ozturk No 2 Trust which do not form part of the Directed Trial, I am satisfied that Dr Cochrane held the shares in the Non -Arena Companies as Dr Smith\u2019s nominee. I would note that neither Dr Cochrane nor Dr Smith now seek to challenge this finding, and I am satisfied that it is established on the evidence. In summary: i) Dr Smith has a track record of seeking to disguise his interest in assets behind Dr Cochrane. The investigations brought by the SFO in connection with the Izodia Theft identified a ski chalet held through a corporate vehicle of which Dr Cochrane was a di rector and the transfer of his luxury car collection into Dr Cochrane\u2019s name shortly after the Izodia Theft came to light. A1.5/39 24 ii) Although notionally assetless, Dr Smith has been able to live \u201chigh on the hog\u201d (in his own phrase) off assets notionally owned by Dr Cochrane, spending those assets in accordance with Dr Smith\u2019s idiosyncratic tastes (including a commissioned water clo ck and artwork chosen by Dr Smith) or for his personal benefit (for example on private jet travel,",

A1.5/39 24 ii) Although notionally assetless, Dr Smith has been able to live \u201chigh on the hog\u201d (in his own phrase) off assets notionally owned by Dr Cochrane, spending those assets in accordance with Dr Smith\u2019s idiosyncratic tastes (including a commissioned water clo ck and artwork chosen by Dr Smith) or for his personal benefit (for example on private jet travel, much of which involved Dr Smith travelling alone). While I accept that much of the money spent by Dr Smith belonged to others, the freedom with which he diss ipated assets notionally in Dr Cochrane\u2019s ownership is relevant when considering whether such interest as Dr Cochrane had in those assets was held in her own right, or as Dr Smith\u2019s nominee. iii) Dr Cochrane has on a number of occasions proclaimed that she is a \u201cbusy GP with two young daughters and no real business experience\u201d, with minimal knowledge of Dr Smith\u2019s business activities. Dr Smith has himself accepted that Dr Cochrane lacked \u201cany independent experience of the world of business, the world of property deals \u201d. The vast network of companies which she apparently owns, and the complex web of dealings in which those companies have engaged, strongly support the suggestion that her involvem ent is nothing more than as a cipher, and that Dr Smith \u2013 with his extensive track -record of complex, contrived and dishonest business dealings \u2013 is \u201ccalling the shots\u201d . iv) Dr Cochrane has no obvious sources of independent wealth from which she might have acquired these assets independently of Dr Smith. In 2005, according to her own evidence, she was close to destitution, and in 2014 and 2016, she gave accounts of her assets and wealth which identified no substantial assets beyond those transferred under the IOM Settlement . v) The confiscation order made against Dr Smith gave him every incentive to hide his ownership of assets behind a nominee owner who he could trust to follow his directions. It is clear that Dr Smith has acted at all times since the Confiscation Order was made with a view to making it appear as if he has no assets \u2013 for example his Deed of Separation with Dr Cochrane of 11 March 2014 sought to give Dr Smith all the benefits o f certain properties, while transferring no property for the SFO to attach. 69 The Slip Rule Application Ruling constituted an unambiguous rejection of Dr Cochrane\u2019s contention that she was entitled to treat Orb\u2019s assets as her own on the basis that Orb was not a Non -Arena Company. By extension, her contention that Orb\u2019s assets should be A1.5/40 25 treated as her own for the purposes of determining her balance sheet solvency is unsustainable . Notwithstanding this definitive ruling (and the Directed Trial Judgment and the LCL Settlement Agreement ), this assertion as to Dr Cochrane\u2019s ownership of Orb was advanced in Dr Cochrane\u2019s Third Affidavit of 11 March 2024 in support of her Amended Representation (pages 348-364) (as described in more detail at paragraph 33 of Appendix 2 below), in which at paragraph 28 she states that she \u201c holds 100% of the shares of Orb a.r.l \u201d (omitting any mention of the findings of the Directed Trial in relation to Orb) and then, at paragraph 35, claims that Orb\u2019s assets are \u201c relevant in calculating [her] balance sheet solvency \u201d.

I respectfully suggest that, in so doing, she was seeking actively to mislead the Jersey Court. 70 Perhaps in response to the concerns raised by the Jersey Court over her characterisation of the ownership of Orb , Dr Cochrane \u2019s position in Jersey has more recently developed, such that she now concedes that \u201cit is correct that paragra ph 16 of the Order of Foxton J dated 11 June 2021 \u2026 states that Dr Smith holds 100 % of the equitable interest of the shares in the Non -Arena Companies (listed in Schedule 2 of that Order )\u201d. However, in order to maintain her position in respect of Orb\u2019s recall application, Dr Co chrane now argues that \u201cthe Directed Trial did not determine the ownership of the assets owned by the Non -Arena Companies \u201d, which, for the first time, she now asserts \u201c are held on resulting trust of [sic] the benefit of the Orb Claimants \u201d. (page 1061 ) Dr Cochrane has not yet elucidated how her arguments regarding Orb are to her own benefit, given that she holds no interest in Orb , and it is not a fully accurate statement in any event, given that the IUAs (which the Directed Trial did determine ownership of ) were owned by various Non -Arena Companies . 71 A summary of the background to Dr Cochrane\u2019s Jersey Recall Applications is set out in Appendix 2 to this statement , which has been prepared with the assistance of Harbour\u2019s Jersey lawyers . F. The PACCAR Decision and its relevance to the Harbour IA 72 This Court will be aware of the PACCAR Decision. By way of very brief summary, the Supreme Court found that certain litigation funding agreements fell within the definition of DBAs , for the purposes of the section 58AA of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (\u201cCLSA 1990 \u201d). 73 However, in order to establish if the Harbour IA is in fact a DBA, a thorough analysis is required of the relevant regulatory framework, and of the Harbour IA itself. A1.5/41 26 74 For an agreement to qualify as a damages based agreement, such that it is subject to the DBA Regulations, it must satisfy three requirements (see Section 58AA (3) CLSA 1990 ): 74.1 First, it must be an agreement between a person providing \u201c advocacy services, litigation services or claims management services \u201d and the recipient of those services; 74.2 Second, it must provide for the recipient \u201c to make a payment to the service provider if the recipient obtains a specified financial benefit in connection with the matter in relation to which the services are provided \u201d; and 74.3 Third, the amount of that payment must be \u201c determined by reference to the amount of the financial benefit obtained by the recipient \u201d. 75 My understanding is that the PACCAR Decision revolved principally around the first of these grounds, and established that litigation funders were providers of \u201c claims management services \u201d. Harbour cannot, and does not, dispute this finding or the reasoned conclusions of the Supreme Court before this Court (although it reserves its position in the event that any other point ultimately had to be determined by the Supreme Court) .15 As such, for these purposes Harbour proceeds on the",

Harbour cannot, and does not, dispute this finding or the reasoned conclusions of the Supreme Court before this Court (although it reserves its position in the event that any other point ultimately had to be determined by the Supreme Court) .15 As such, for these purposes Harbour proceeds on the basis that it provides claims management services, and thus the Harbour IA satisfies the first requirement of a DBA according to the CLSA 1990. 76 In relation to the second requirement, I understand this to apply to any contingent funding, non-recourse agreement whereby the funder will only receive a return if the funded parties succeed and proceeds are received. This is the basis upon which Harbour and other funders structure their funding agreements, and Harbour will not seek to contend otherwise in respect of the Harbour IA. 77 For the purposes of this statement, I will focus on the third CLSA requirement, namely that a DBA contains provision for a funder\u2019s return which are \u201c determined by reference to the amount of the financial benefit obtained by the recipient \u201d. I understand this to mean, in simple terms, where a funding agreement provides for a funder\u2019s return to be calculat ed by 15 I note, however, that considerable efforts have been made by the legislature to introduce legislation in order to correct this position, which appears not to have been intended by the drafters of the amendment to the CLSA 1990. Unfortunately given the timing of the General Election , it has not yet been possible for this legislation to be passed. While Harbour, alongside others in the funding industry, remain hopeful that such legislation will be introduced, in the intervening period the PACCAR Decision has allowed parties such as Dr Cochrane and others to seek to undermine funding agreements such as the Harbour IA notwithstanding the fact that the funded parties have taken the benefit of the funding . A1.5/42 27 reference to a percentage of the proceeds of the funded action, and it also satisfies the first two criteria set out above, it will meet the definition of a DBA. 78 The Harbour IA , at Schedule 2, contains a mechanism for calculating Harbour\u2019s return in the event that the Orb Claimants succeeded in the funded proceedings, which I extract below (\u201cSchedule 2 \u201d): 79 This tiered structure was agreed in order to account for both the time period of the receipt of any Proceeds, as well as the amount of such proceeds. As I understand it, this again conforms with standard industry practice. The first two rows were agreed to cover the eventuality of an early settlemen t of the funded proceedings, in order to allow for greater A1.5/43 28 recovery by the Orb Claimants in the event that the proceedings were brief. Harbour\u2019s return is therefore based on recovery both on a percentage basis, and by reference to a multiple of its investment. 80 If a funding agreement meets the criteria set out in the CLSA 1990 it is a DBA which must also comply with the requirements of the DBA Regulations , in particular Section 3 of those regulations: 3. The requirements prescribed for the purposes of section 58AA(4)(c) of the Act are that the terms and conditions of a damages -based agreement must specify \u2014 (a) the claim or proceedings or parts of them to which the agreement relates; (b) the circumstances in which the representative\u2019s payment, expenses and",

The requirements prescribed for the purposes of section 58AA(4)(c) of the Act are that the terms and conditions of a damages -based agreement must specify \u2014 (a) the claim or proceedings or parts of them to which the agreement relates; (b) the circumstances in which the representative\u2019s payment, expenses and costs, or part of them, are payable; and (c) the reason for setting the amount of the payment at the level agreed, which, in an employment matter, shall include having regard to, where appropriate, whether the claim or proceedings is one of several similar claims or proceedings. 81 It is my understanding that it has never been standard practice in the funding industry, as reflected in the approach taken in the Harbour IA , to include reasons in funding agreements for the funder\u2019s return. No such reasons are set out in the Harbour IA. As such, again, Harbour does not conten d that the Harbour IA meets the requirements of the DBA Regulations. I note that the Minister of State responsible for piloting the DBA Regulations through Parliament, Lord McNally, followed up questions on the draft regulations in Grand Committee with a formal written response to Lord Beecham on 5 March 20 13 (pages 50 6-510), shortly before they were promulgated on 1 April 2013 . He stated that: \u201c The DBA Re gulations update the 2010 regulations, and take account of recommendations made by the Civil Justice Council (CJC) .\u201d 82 The CJC\u2019s position had been set out in a letter dated 24 October 2012 to the Ministry of Justice (pages 5 11-514) in the context of the statutory consultation required under LASPO , which was also extended to non -statutory stakeholders . Among the CJC\u2019s recommendations had been a proposed amendment to the information required to be given to a client entering a DBA , which referred to the availability of other methods of financing the claim or financing the proceedings. The CJC suggested the addition of third A1.5/44 29 party litigation funding into the list, reflecting its view that this was a type of alternative to a DBA, not a DBA itself , and that the Government was not consulting on the basis that litigation funding agreements would be subject to the regulations . 83 The CJC\u2019s suggestion was not taken up. However, in Lord McNally\u2019s letter, u nder the heading \u201cThird party litigation funding\u201d he expressly stated on behalf of the Government : The matter was debated at some length during the passage of the LASPO Act through Parliament. Some colleagues were concerned about the future growth of third party litigation funding arrangements and, in particular, a move into personal injury claims. While there was a call for the introduction of statutory regulation, the Government does not believe this is the right course of action at this stage: rather this is an issue that we are keeping under review and we will not hesitate to act should we need to do so in the future.

Indeed, shortly after the conclusion of the Directed Trial, on 9 August 2021, my firm received a letter from Mr Spragg of Keystone Law, solicitors to Litigation Capital Limited (\u201c LCL \u201d)16, arguing that Harbour did not succeed at the Directed Trial and therefore the LCL Settlement Agreement had \u201c no continuing force or effect \u201d (page 515). We responded on 12 August 2021, refuting this assertion. Mr Spragg responded on 16 August 2021, noting (without explanation) that: \u2022 \u201cThe judgement awarded all the assets to the Orb Claimants, \u2022 The LCL parties\u2019 \u2013 SPs parties\u2019 agreement was conditional and between themselves. It did not include the Orb Claimants, \u2022 LCL did not release the Orb Claimants \u201d (pages 516-517). 87 The background to LCL \u2019s involvement in these proceedings is well known to the Court and I will not rehearse it in detail here. In short, LCL is a vehicle of the Smith Parties, and at various times Dr Cochrane, Mr Taylor and Mr Anthony Smith (Dr Smith\u2019s brother) 16 On 24 November 2021 , we received an email from an \u2018Admin LCL\u2019 proton mail account attaching a document headed \u2018Notice of Change\u2019 which stated that Keystone Law no longer acted for LCL and that LCL would be acting in person. A1.5/47 32 have been its directors. I n the circumstances, therefore , Mr Spragg\u2019s correspondence was sent in the interests (and most likely at the direction) of Dr Smith, Dr Cochrane and Messrs Thomas and Taylor , who , as early as two months after the Consequentials Order was made, were already putting into motion plans to prevent the Settlement Parties from enforcing the rights they had established at the Directed Trial. While no party has formally sought to challenge the validity of the LCL Settlement Agreement, sever al of the Smith Parties have acted in clear breach of its terms. I summarise several such acts below, and refer to further details which are set out in Appendix 1: 87.1 Mr Thomas appears to have colluded with LCL in relation to its efforts in the Republic of the Marshall Islands to frustrate the efforts of the",

I summarise several such acts below, and refer to further details which are set out in Appendix 1: 87.1 Mr Thomas appears to have colluded with LCL in relation to its efforts in the Republic of the Marshall Islands to frustrate the efforts of the Enforcement Receivers, in contravention of LCLs\u2019 obligations under the LCL Settlement Agreement and the LCL Disco ntinuance Order. In doing so, Mr Thomas incited a clear breach of the LCL Discontinuance Order by LCL. The Enforcement Receivers commenced contempt proceedings against Mr Thomas, which were ultimately discontinued when Mr Thomas corrected the position. 87.2 Dr Smith directly committed numerous breaches of the LCL Settlement Agreement by impeding the Enforcement Receivers\u2019 attempts to manage and realise assets to which Harbour is entitled pursuant to the Directed Trial Judgment, namely the Hamilton House properties; 87.3 Dr Cochrane breached her obligations under the LCL Settlement Agreement by impeding the efforts of the Enforcement Receivers to manage and realise properties in Spain, which ultimately led to the ruling of 18 April 2024 to which I refer below. 88 In the case of Dr Cochrane, as I outline above, the release of claims under the LCL Settlement is directly relevant to the Jersey Recall Applications . This is because Dr Cochrane has asserted proprietary rights over Orb (which also disregards the outcome of the Directed Trial) , as well as listing within her estate various properties to which she has waived any rights by way of the LCL Settlement Agreement . 89 Although this will be a matter for development in submissions, Harbour\u2019s position is that the release and waiver given by Dr Cochrane and the other Smith Parties under the LCL Settlement Agreement is broad and (as set out above) extends to, among other things: \u201call A1.5/48 33 and any actions, claims, rights, demands and set -offs, whether capable of being litigated or enforced in this jurisdiction or any other, whether presently known or unknown to the Parties or to the law, and whether arising in law or equity, under statute or otherwise, that they have, had, may have or hereafter can or shall or may subsequently acquire \u2026\u201d 90 The LCL Settlement Agreement also contains no -contest clauses. I would respectfully suggest that , taken as a whole, the LCL Settlement Agreement precludes Dr Cochrane from seeking to ventilate the arguments that she does in relation to the effect of PACCAR on the Directed Trial Judgment and the Harbour IA in the Jersey Proceedings \u2013 she has agreed to a full settlement and is no longer entitled to seek to go behind Harbour\u2019s entitlements. 91 As I explain above, while LCL (and thus, undoubtedly, Dr Smith) questioned the validity and enforceability of the LCL Settlement Agreement, Dr Cochrane has not formally advanced this position, as far as Harbour is aware . Instead, in her Jersey Recall Applications she has sought simply to ignore it. As the Court is aware, however, the issue of the validity of the LCL Settlement Agreement (and more specifically the LCL Discontinuance Order) came before the Court earlier this year and has been determined . 92 While Harbour was not directly involved, I am aware of a ruling in these proceedings given on 18 April 2024 (the \u201c LCL Undertakings Ruling \u201d) (pages 518-519). I understand the context of this ruling is complex, and relates to efforts made by the Enforcement Receivers to carry",

I understand the context of this ruling is complex, and relates to efforts made by the Enforcement Receivers to carry out their duties to realise certain assets in Spain, which Dr Cochrane has incorrectly asserted belong to the Orb Claimants. As set out above and further explained in Appendix 1, Dr Cochrane has impeded the efforts of the Enforcement Rec eivers, in direct contravention of the undertakings she gave in the LCL Discontinuance Order, which reflect Dr Cochrane\u2019s obligations pursuant to the LCL Settlement Agreement, and which are accompanied by a penal notice. 93 My understanding is that the LCL Undertakings Ruling\u2019s effect was to confirm the binding nature of the undertakings contained within the LCL Discontinuance Order. As such, I respectfully suggest that Dr Cochrane\u2019s obligations under the LCL Settlement Agree ment remain valid and binding and that the Court has already finally determined this question . 94 I also note that the LCL Undertakings Ruling contained the following finding at paragraph 12: A1.5/49 34 \u201cDr Cochrane has no standing to act in any form of trustee capacity on behalf of the Orb Claimants, still less to take decisions intended to give Dr Smith (who is not an Orb Claimant) the use of any assets .\u201d 95 I consider it likely that Dr Cochrane\u2019s Jersey Recall Applications are being conducted with the assistance, and likely at the direction of Dr Smith, who seeks to regain control of the property which is within Dr Cochrane and Orb\u2019s d\u00e9sastres . 96 On the basis of the foregoing, I respectfully ask the Court to grant the relief sought by Harbour in reliance upon the LCL Settlement Agreement, as set out at paragraph 5.1 above. 97 A second issue arising from an agreement affects both Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas, to the extent that they might otherwise be able to attack the Harbour IA on the basis of the PACCAR Decision. The 2014 Harbour Deed was signed from October 2014 onwards, and postdated the receipt of the assets under the IOM Settlement. Each of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas (amongst others) agreed that the recoveries under the IOM Settlement were to be treated as \u201cProceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings\u201d for the purposes of Cl 9.1 of the Harbour IA and were to be applied in accordance with the terms of that clause. Accordingly, each of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas are estopped by deed from contesting that position. In addition, the 2014 Harbour Deed is on any view not a DBA \u2013 it no longer relates to a future contingency, but regulates the effect of an event that had by that stage already happened. H. The abusive nature of the Smith Parties\u2019 attempt to seek to invalidate the Harbour IA 98 Harbour's position is that the Orb Claimants could have argued that the Harbour IA was a DBA and sought to undermine Harbour\u2019s entitlement under the agreement at any time after it was agreed (although possibly not immediately) . The DBA Regulations entered into force on 1 April 2013, and the Harbour IA was executed on 10 July 2013. As set out above, it is accepted that at that point, not even the Government believed that the DBA Regulations were going to apply",

As set out above, it is accepted that at that point, not even the Government believed that the DBA Regulations were going to apply to litigation funding agreements. 99 The litigation which gave rise to the PACCAR Decision (the \u201c Trucks Dispute \u201d) arose in the Competition Appeals Tribunal (the \u201c CAT \u201d). It is not necessary for me to explain the background to those proceedings, save that the hearing in front of the CAT at which the issue of whether litigation funding agreements were Damages Based Agreements took A1.5/50 35 place from 4 to 6 June 2019 (the \u201c Trucks Judgment (Funding)17\u201d). The Trucks Judgment (Funding) was handed down on 28 October 2019 , and subsequently the same arguments regarding the status of litigation funding agreements were ventilated before the Court of Appeal in relation to an application by the defendants in the Trucks Dispute for permission to appeal or alternatively for permission to bring proceedings for judicial review, a decision which was handed down on 5 March 2021 ( Paccar Inc. v RHA and UKTC [2021] EWCA Civ 299 (the \u201c PACCAR Court of Appeal Decision \u201d)).18 100 Both of these decisions made it clear that arguments about the status of litigation funding agreements at DBAs were \u2018live\u2019 and had been published in high profile judgments since late 2019. Both the Trucks Judgment (Funding) and the PACCAR Court of Appeal Decision also refer to an article published in the Cambridge Law Journal in 2014, by Professor Rachel Mulheron , title d \u201cEngland's unique approach to the self -regulation of third party funding: a critical analysis of recent developments \u201d (the \u201c Mulheron Analysis\u201d)19 (pages 520-553). The Mulheron Analysis, in my view , contains a thorough breakdown of the primary arguments which would, several years later, be advanced by the defendant parties in the lead up to the Trucks Judgment (Funding) , and later by those same parties in their application to the Supreme Court . 101 In particular, Prof. Mulheron expends several pages on a detailed analysis of question of whether litigation funders, according t o the rules of statutory interpretation, provide \u201c claims management services \u201d, as defined in section 58AA of the CLSA 1990. While she concedes that the drafting of the relevant provisions may give rise to a degree of uncertainty, she concludes that \u201cthe author considers that any application which sought to render a LFA unenforceable because it did not meet the requirements of the DBA Regulations 2013 would be bound to fail. \u201d Professor Mulheron also noted that the possibility that funding agreements were caug ht by the DBA Regulations 2013 had been \u201c ventured in some quarters since the implementation of the 17 https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/CAT/2019/26.html 18 https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/2021/299.html , at paragraph 80(2) \u201cThe Tribunal next pointed out that the argument now advanced by DAF \"is not altogether novel\": see [37].

A1.5/51 36 DBA Regulations 2013 \u201d.20 The author also notes that the debate \u201c has been the subject of comment at several conferences since the Jackson reforms took effect .\u201d21 102 While I understand that Professor Mulheron reached the conclusion that litigation funding agreements were very unlikely to qualify as damages based agreement s, this very clearly shows that the arguments raised by the parties to the PACCAR Decision were not novel, and could have been run on behalf of the Orb Claimants , Dr Cochrane , or any other party to these proceedings . 103 I also note that in an open letter to the Lord Chancellor of 16 April 2024 (pages 554-555), to which Mr Thomas and Dr Smith appended their signatures and which sought to persuade the Government not to introduce the retrospective aspects of the Litigation Funding (Enforceability) Bill , the authors concede that \u201c The law has always been that litigation funders provide claims management services and therefore their LFAs are DBAs (provided Section 58AA(3) of the CLSA 1990 is engaged) and are subject to regulatio n. The Supreme Court in PACCAR simply confirmed this position. That the point had not been judicially considered before is irrelevant: Professor Rachel Mulheron (whose views the litigation funders will be well aware) first raised the point almost a decade ago.\u201d 104 Despite Professor Mulheron\u2019s conclusions, she and those working with her clearly remained concerned that greater clarity was required in this area, and undertook to engage with the Civil Justice Council on a consultation called the Damages Based Agreements Reform Project, the conclusions of which were published in August 2015 (the \u201c CJC DBA Report \u201d).22 The aim of this consultation was to make recommendations to the government regarding revisions to the DBA Regulations 2013, with a view to the enactment of the DBA Regulations 2015. 105 In the event, the DBA Regulations 2015 were never adopted. However, noting that while \u201cit was extremely unlikely that Third Party Funders were inadvertently covered by the 2013 DBA Regulations \u2026 the intent of the Ministry of Justice to set any remote residual uncertainty about the point at nought was noted \u201d. The authors recommended specifically excluding litigation funders in the revised report. 20 Mulheron Analysis, page 3, paragraph 1 21 Ibid, footnote 140 22 https://www.judiciary.uk/wp -content/uploads/2015/09/dba -reform -project -cjc-aug-2015.pdf A1.5/52 37 106 I note that until mid-2016 , the Orb Claimants were represented by Stewarts Law, a firm with a very detailed understanding of litigation funding, and who were no doubt aware of the principles I outline above. It is also evident to me, however, that the Orb Claimants would have had n o commercial interest seeking to undermine the Harbour IA while they were represented by Stewarts. Harbour complied with the Harbour IA fully and provided the Orb claimants with around \u00a35.2m of litigation funding. 107 However, despite the deterioration of the relationship between the Orb Claimants and Harbour, which ultimately resulted in Harbour successfully establishing its rights under the Harbour IA at the Directed Trial, neither",

Their opportunities to do so were extremely extensive, given the lengthy nature of these proceedings. I set out at Annex 1 a timetable of the relevant procedural steps in these proceedings. This clearly shows that the Orb Claimants have had numerous opportunities to advance an argument as to the enforceability of the Harbour IA , from mid-2017 (when the first \u201c assets and claims position papers\u201d were produced by the parties, including the Orb Claimants) until July 2021 when the opportunity to appeal the Consequentials Order expired. 108 In particular, the Orb Claimants had multiple opportunities during the lead up to the Directed Trial to advance claims in respect of the validity of the Harbour IA , including : 108.1 Five C ase Management Conference ( CMC ) hearings. The purpose of three of those CMCs was to establish the scope of assets and issues to be determined at the Directed Trial. 108.2 Pursuant to court order s, at least three requirements for parties to file statements outlining their position, including by way of a statement of case or position paper, and consequential amendments to the same. Applications to amend parties\u2019 pleadings were being made as late as 31 December 2020 following the PTR , at which time LCL (one of the Smith Parties) applied to amend its statement of case. 108.3 Witness statements of fact, both trial witness statements and those in respect of interlocutory applications such as, for example , the guillotine hearing that culminated in the assets being identified as the subject matter of the Directed Trial. A1.5/53 38 108.4 The Directed Trial itself, which spanned 7 weeks, represented a significant opportunity for the Orb Claimants to advance their position. It should be noted that during the trial period, extensive submissions on a wide range of issues were put forward by numerous parties to the litigation , in some instances for the first time. No stone was left unturned, and all matters raised were exhaustively deliberated. 109 I note also that Harbour\u2019s Statement of Case in these proceedings of 29 November 2017 stated at paragraph 7 that \u201c Harbour intends to rely upon the Harbour Funding Agreement in these proceedings for its full terms and true effect \u201d. It went on at paragraph 15 to state that \u201c Harbour entered into the Harbour Funding Agreement in good faith, in the ordinary course of business and on ordinary terms (including terms as to its remuneration and success fee )\u2026\u201d. 110 In response, Messrs Thomas and Taylor in their Responsive Statement of Case of 28 July 2019 , at paragraph 24, stated that \u201c These Respondents accept a s accurate in all material respects the summary of the Harbour Funding Agreement given in paragraphs 5 to 16 of Harbour\u2019s Statement of Case dated 29 November 2017\u2026 \u201d 111 It is notable that t he SFO\u2019s responsive statement of case",

No admissions are made as to the validity and enforceability of the Harbour Investment Agreement \u201d. 112 Harbour\u2019s Amended Responsive Statement of Case of 10 April 2019, stated at paragraph s 7 and 8: \u201c7. Harbour relies on the Harbour Funding Agreement as the foundation for its claim under the Harbour Trust: see paras 5 -27 of its SOC. The Viscount supports Harbour\u2019s case in relation to the Harbour Funding Agreement at paras 55 -65 of her SOC \u2026. 8. As for the contentions advanced by certain other Interested Parties in relation to the Harbour Funding Agreement : a. It is noted t hat no Interested Party challenges the validity of the Harbour Funding Agreement \u2026\u201d 113 It is clear that the validity and enforceability of the Harbour IA was relied upon by Harbour from the outset of these proceedings, and that no party chose to actively challenge Harbour\u2019s position. It is entirely unsurprising, therefore, that the Directed Trial did not need expressly to confirm that status . A1.5/54 39 114 Accordingly, the Smith Parties have had ample opportunities to argue that the Harbour IA was subject to the DBA regulations and failed to do so. I would respectfully suggest that these matters are res judicata, or give rise to cause of action or issue estoppel, or that it would be abusive , for reasons that will be expanded upon in submissions, for them to be allowed to do so now. I. The Severability of the Harbour IA 115 Given the PACCAR Decision , if the above points do not determine the matter in Harbour\u2019s favour, there appears to be a risk that the Harbour IA would be found by a court to be a non -compliant DBA. I note, however, that t he Harbour IA also includes a clause headed \u201cSeverability\u201d, which provides that: \u201cIf any term or provision in this Agreement shall in whole or in part be held to any extent to be illegal or unenforceable under any enactment or rule of law, that term or provision or part shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement a nd the enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected \u201d. 116 It is my understanding that the percentage -based recovery provisions in Schedule 2 are capable of being severed , such that the agreement remains enforceable . I do not seek to make submissions in this witness statement as to the legal position in respect of sever ability . However I will , for the Court\u2019s convenience, set out below my understanding of how this would operate in practice. 117 Harbour\u2019s entitlement in respect of any proceeds up to \u00a340 million is calculated on a n alternative basis , depending on when such proceeds are received. In respect of this agreement, the initial period in respect of proceeds received either 6 or 12 months after the agreement was signed, expired in 10 July 201 3, over 10 years ago. 118",

In respect of this agreement, the initial period in respect of proceeds received either 6 or 12 months after the agreement was signed, expired in 10 July 201 3, over 10 years ago. 118 The final two rows are intended to determine Harbour\u2019s recoveries if the proceeds exceed \u00a340 million, and are calculated on a percentage basis only. It is also worth noting, although not a necessary factor in this exercise, that Harbour does not expect the proceeds to exceed \u00a340 million , indeed they are likely to be significantly less , not least because the costs of the relevant office holders charged with realising the assets have been significantly inflated by the actions of the Smith Parties since the Di rected Trial . A1.5/55 40 119 As long ago as 2 July 2021, not long after the Directed Trial Judgment, my firm wrote to Messrs Thomas and Taylor setting out the likely proceeds, including estimated values of the relevant assets (which are now signifi cantly out of date, and which are likely to be significantly reduced as at today\u2019s date) (pages 556-563). We also made it clear that Harbour expected its minimum return to be calculated on the basis of the multiples included in Schedule 2. It should be noted that the Orb Claimants (Messrs Tho mas and Taylor in particular) have on several occasions asserted that they expect the proceeds to be considerably more than \u00a340 million. In any event , I respectfully suggest that such dispute is not material at this stage. 120 It is Harbour\u2019s belief that the sections of Schedule 2 which contain a percentage based recovery can be severed from the Harbour IA, to the extent that they are \u201cillegal or unenforceable\u201d , in accordance with the severability provisions of the agreement . This is a straightforward exercise in contractual in terpretation which does not require reference to the general common law principles concerning severance , or to satisfy th e general common law test . In particular , in the contractual interpretation context the court is not limited to deletions, it does not matter whether there is surplus language left over and there is no need to consider whether the overall balance of the contract remains the sa me. 121 However, Harbour also intends to argue in the alternative that the general common law test can be satisfied in any event . I set out below another version of Schedule 2 which demonstrates where such modifications are necessary (the \u201c Modified Schedule 2 \u201d). I note also that in pre -action correspondence, having received the draft of this Application, Marriot Harrison has indicated that Mr Thomas disagrees with Harbour application of the principles of severability in respect of the proposed Modified Schedule 2. These objections would only appear to have application to the common law approach not the exercise in contractual interpretation referred to above. Harbour reserves its position in this regard, including as to the further modification of Schedule 2 and any arguments about how the surviving wording may be interpreted , pending receipt of Mr Thomas\u2019s responsive evidence. A1.5/56 41 122 It is my understanding that, for severance to be possible at common law , three requirements must be satisfied: 122.1 First, it must be possible to remove the offending language without adding to or modifying other language (known as",

A1.5/57 42 122.3 Third, the resulting contract must not be of a different nature to the original agreement, such that it is not the sort of contract that the parties entered into at all. 123 As to the Blue Pencil Test, I would respectfully suggest to the Court that the Modified Schedule 2 provisions are workable, and do not require any re -writing or amendment in order to be understood. In fact, they read as plain English, as if the severed provisions had never been included. The nature of the agreement has not changed . 124 The only other passage in the Harbour IA which refers to Harbour\u2019s entitlement to a percentage of proceeds is contained within Clause 10 .2(e): \u201c10.2 Where, pursuant to clause 4.2(i), the Claimants receive a recommendation from the Legal Representatives to accept an offer of Settlement made on behalf of one or more Defendants (the \"Recommended Offer\") but the Claimants elect to reject the Recommended Offer, if the Proceeds eventually recovered from such Defend ant or Defendants are less than the amount of the Recommended Offer, the Claimants shall hold such Proceeds on bare Trust absolutely for the benefit of HF2 and the Claimants and to the extent of their interests as Trust Beneficiaries The Claimants shall ad ditionally keep such Proceeds separate from the Claimants' own funds and shall apply the Proceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings in the following order upon receipt of such Proceeds: (a) deduct all stamp duties, bank charges and currency exchange costs payable by the Claimants relating to or arising out of any such Success in the Proceedings; (b) pay to HF2 the HF2 Investment; (c) pay any other sums due in respect of Claimants' Legal Costs; (d) pay to the Legal Representatives, Barristers or other third parties with whom the Claimants have concluded a Legal Costs Agreement any success fee or costs uplift payable under any such Legal Costs Agreement; (e) pay to HF2 any amount due to it in its capacity as Trust Beneficiary pursuant to Schedule 2 save that the percentage of Proceeds payable to HF2 shall be calculated by reference to the amount of the Recommended Offer and not by reference to the amount o f the Proceeds; and A1.5/58 43 (f) pay to the Claimants any remaining amount which the Claimants shall receive in their capacity as Trust Beneficiaries .\u201d 125 All that is required in this section of the agreement is the deletion of the second half of Clause 10.2(e), from the words \u201c save that \u201d to the end of the clause and in any event Clause 10.2(e) has no relevance to the current situation .

Again , the balance of the clause remains entirely coherent , without any further amendments necessary. 126 I note that the Thomas Letter Before Action also refers to the provisions of Clause 14 of the Harbour IA . I understand the implication of the letter to be that , according to Mr Thomas, Clause 14.4(a)(ii) of the Harbour IA also contains provisions that cause Harbour\u2019s return to be \u201cdetermined by reference to the amount of the financial benefit obtained by the recipient \u201d, in accordance with the third of the DBA requirements of the CLSA 1990. However, I do not believe this to be the case (and again it has no relevance to the current situation) . 127 Clause 14 .4 reads as follows: \u201c14.4 In the event that the Claimants continue with the Proceedings after the Termination Date and the Claimants subsequently Succeed in such Proceedings, the Claimants agree on a joint and several basis that: (a) they will hold all Proceeds on bare Trust absolutely for the Claimants and HF2 and to the extent of their interests as Trust Beneficiaries, such Proceeds will be kept separate from the Claimants' own funds and the Claimants shall as trustee of the Trus t forthwith pay to HF2 an amount from the Proceeds corresponding to: (i) the HF2 Investment up to the Termination Date; and (ii) a sum calculated by applying 10% per annum on the amounts referred to in subclause 14.4(a)(i), calculated from the date of each payment out (or assumption of liability for Adverse Costs) by HF2 to the date of refund to HF2 by the Claimants. (b) The provisions of clauses 8 and 9 and payment to HF2 under the Trust, will apply as if this Agreement had continued in force, SAVE THAT the amount of Proceeds payable to HF2 under Schedule 2 shall be fixed by reference to the Termination Date and not t he date of receipt of monies by HF2 following Success in the Proceedings; and A1.5/59 44 (c) the Claimants shall not be obliged to make payments to HF2 under the terms of this Trust that are more than the Proceeds it recovers. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause 14.4 shall survive any termination of this Agreement .\u201d 128 Although the Thomas Letter Before Action does not clearly set out the basis of Mr Thomas\u2019s assertion in relation to this provision, I assume that Mr Thomas\u2019s case is that a reference in 14.4(a)(ii) to a sum of 10% per annum due to Harbour renders this clause a DBA provision in that by its nature a percentage is determined by to a separate figure. However, the figure which determines the amount of the percentage due in this instance is Harbour\u2019s investment, rather than the amount of any proceeds. This is eff ectively a provision for Harbour to recover interest on its investment in the instance that the Harbour IA is terminated before proceeds are received by the Orb Claimants. Therefore by definition , if this clause were to be invoked, the Orb Claimants would have not yet received any financial benefit for Harbour\u2019s return to be calculated by reference to. I do not understand the third criterion of the CLSA 1990 to be intended to refer to this scenario, therefore there is no need to consider the severance of this provision.",

I do not understand the third criterion of the CLSA 1990 to be intended to refer to this scenario, therefore there is no need to consider the severance of this provision. 129 Finall y, I also understand Mr Thom as to intend to argue that the provisions of part of Clause 9 of the Harbour IA would render the agreement a DBA, specifically Clause 9.3. Mr Thomas\u2019s position has not been made completely clear in correspondence , and as such Harbour reserves its position and will respond more fully in due course if necessary . 130 As to the second requirement of the severability test , which is that the resulting contract should still be supported by adequate consideration, I would respectfully suggest that this would be satisfied. Harbour would still be providing consideration by way of its promise to provide funding to the Orb Claimants (and the provision of funding) , and the Orb Claimants would be providing consideration by way of their promise to hold on trust the Proceeds on Success, and to pay to Harbour, out of those proceeds, (1) the amount of the investment and (2) a return, calculated now as a multiple of Harbour\u2019s investment . 131 As to the third requirement (that the nature of the agreement should not be altered such that it becomes quite different to that originally agreed), as I outline above, the Harbour IA only requires amend ment in very limited respects . The essence of the agreement remains unchanged , namely that Harbour agree d to fund the Orb Claimants in exchange A1.5/60 45 for a return should Proceeds be recovered. The potential change in Harbour\u2019s entitlement is a matter of degree, and not a change in the inherent commercial nature of the agreement . 132 In the alternative, Harbour\u2019s case will be that at a bare minimum, its contractual right to repayment of the investment (plus interest at 10% per annum as stipulated in clause 17.1 of the Harbour IA )24 remains unimpaired. This is specified in Cl 9.1(b) , and is unaffected by any finding that the return elements of the Harbour IA are unenforceable. 133 I note that the severance approach is not the only available analysis of how to deal with statutory unenforceability. It will be a matter of submission as to whether it is the correct framework within which to assess the issue, as opposed, by way of example only, to an interpretation of the Harbour IA which locates the DBA within a confined portion of the larger whole and which does not have effects outside of that portion. 134 Finally, Mr Thomas has suggested that even if Harbour\u2019s case on severa nce succeeds, the resulting agreement must somehow conform to the requirements of the CLSA 1990. Mr Thomas has not explained this principle and as such it would be premature for Harbour\u2019s position to be fully developed here. That said , Harbour would consider the starting point to be that if the Harbour IA is no t a DBA following one of the approaches as set out above , it is not required to meet any criteria set out in S.58AA of the CLSA 1990.

J. Harbour\u2019s detrimental reliance on the Harbour IA 135 Harbour has detrimentally relied upon its understanding that the Harbour IA was an enforceable agreement which conferred upon it particular proprietary rights . In these proceedings, as I note above, H arbour funded the Orb Claimants in the amount of approximately \u00a35.2 million, and has since spent several times that amount enforcing its rights under the Harbour IA. 136 In total, Harbour has expended approximately \u00a3 16.7 million (including amounts advanced by Harbour to the Viscount) as of the date of this evidence , and expects to expend considerably more on dealing with further actions which have been initiated by the Smith Parties. Additionally, the continuing efforts of the Smith Parties and other related individuals to resist the work of court -appo inted office holders w ill further inflate the costs 24 Harbour's position is that contractual interest also accrues pursuant to clause 17.1 in respect of its entire entitlement , including returns on its investment provided for in Schedule 2 of the Harbour IA, should the court find in its favour on this application. A1.5/61 46 associated with managing and realising the assets which were the subject of the Directed Trial and depress ultimate recoveries . 137 The other Settlement Parties submitted their relevant costs to the Court at the time of the costs consequentials hearing following the Directed Trial. These represent only a partial picture of the total costs that those parties have expended , as they reflected only their legal costs incurred during the Directed Trial , i.e. to 2021 . These totals have undoubtedly increased significantly in the subsequent years (including a total of around \u00a31.16 million expended by the Settlement Parties in the context of the Part 8 Claim). 137.1 Stewarts Law: \u00a32.3 million 137.2 The Viscount: \u00a32.5 million 137.3 The SFO: \u00a31.8 million 137.4 The Joint Liquidators: \u00a33.4 million 137.5 The Enforcement Receivers: \u00a33.8 million K. Limitation 138 Harbour will also submit that, as determined in the Directed Trial, Harbour\u2019s right to recovery under the Harbour IA was engaged (at the latest) on 29 April 2016, at the time of execution of a settlement between Dr Smith, Dr Cochrane and Mr Andrew Ruhan (t he \u201cGeneva Settlement \u201d) (the Confidential Deed, which is one of the Geneva Settlement documents is at pages 564-568), which brought to an end the Orb Litigation (which was itself dismissed by way of consent order on 5 May 2016). 139 As such, the time period for the Orb Claimants to contend that the Harbour IA was unenforceable began at the date of the Geneva Settlement, and ended in April 2022, well after the conclusion of the Directed Trial, and during the period in which the Orb Claimants\u2019 c hallenges to the Directed Trial Judgment were well underway. 140 Harbour\u2019s limitation submissions will be developed in due course, but I also note here that, as I set out above, the potential arguments regarding the applicability of the DBA Regulations 2013 to the Harbour IA were publicly available since around the time of the Mulheron Analysis in 2014. As such, the Orb Claimants could have discovered the basis A1.5/62 47 for their potential cause of action at any time from that point in 2014 onwards, and certainly by April 2016. 141",

Harbour\u2019s position in this regard is reserved pending the full articulation by Mr Thomas of the relief he seeks , which depends on how he frames his case as to the basis for any right of recovery \u2013 obviously different limitation periods may apply depending on how this is put . This reservation also extends to Harbour\u2019s right to argue that Mr Thomas is barred by laches from obtaining the relief he seeks , in the circumstances of this case, whether or not a limitation period applies to the relief he seeks . 142 Finally, in pre -action correspondence, Marriott Harrison has indicated that Mr Thomas intends to argue that should his action be time barred, the same should apply to this application by Harbour. Harbour\u2019s position will be developed in submission in due course, but I note that this appears to be a misconceived interpretation of the relief sought by Harbour in this application. Primarily, Harbour seeks declaration s that Mr Thomas, Dr Cochrane or any other party\u2019s actions to undermine the Harbour IA are abusi ve or incorrect, and only if Harbour does not succeed on those grounds, that those parties\u2019 applications are time -barred in terms of advancing the substantive arguments . L. Dr Cochrane\u2019s standing and the Debarring/Stay Directions 143 As she was declared en d\u00e9sastre in November 2016 , Dr Cochrane\u2019s personal interests in these proceedings have been represented by the Viscount . I note, however, that Dr Cochrane executed the LCL Settlement Deed in her personal capacity. 144 In the circumstances, without prejudice to its rights more generally, Harbour is prepared to take a pragmatic position and would not object to Dr Cochrane being permitted to address the Court on the matters dealt with in this application . 145 Given th e Thomas Letter Before Action, it seems that Mr Thomas is likely to seek to oppose Harbour\u2019s application and seek relief that is relevant to the other Orb Claimants as well as himself . In this regard, Harbour \u2019s position is that Mr Thomas remains bound by and must comply , in full, with the terms of the Debarring/Stay Directions before any application or request for relief he makes can proceed. M. Conclusions A1.5/63 48 146 I respectfully submit that Harbour\u2019s present application should be granted on one or more of the bases I set out above. 147 Subject to the Court\u2019s approach in relation to, and determination of, the above matters, further issues may need to be addressed or raised, or directions given, in respect of which Harbour\u2019s position is fully reserved. These include, for example : (a) whether the Guarantee entered into between Harbour and Dr Cochrane renders Dr Cochrane liable for any unenforceable obligations under the Harbour IA in any event , and whether Harbour can hold Dr Cochrane, Mr Thomas and Mr Taylor liable for breach of the represe ntations and warranties at Cl 3.1(g) of the Harbour IA under which they promised that the obligations assumed were \u201clegal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations\u201d in the amount",

(\u201c Casa Coloniches \u201d) Dr Cochrane Dr Cochrane has been consistently non -cooperative regarding the transfer of the share of Casa Coloniches , a Non Arena Company over whose shares the the Enforcement Receivers are appointed. Her actions include initially refusing to sign transfer documents for the shares, initially refusing to appoint the Enforcement Receivers as directors and sign other documents and indicating an intention to oppose the Attorney General of Jersey's representation to vary the saisie judiciaire made by the Royal Court of Jersey on 24 November 2016 to permit the transfer of shares in Casa Coloniches to the Enforcement Receivers which has caused, and continues to cause, significant delay and cost.25 Ongoing (from February 2021) Obstruction by associates of Smith in bringing claims against companies controlled by the Enforcement Receivers and opposing the recognition of the Enforcement Receivers and Directed Trial Judgment in proceedings in the Republic of the Marshall Islands Smith parties and Thomas In February 2021, Simon Cooper and Simon McNally commenced claims against SMA and GACH (both Non -Arena Companies) in the Republic of the Marshall Islands which the Enforcement Receivers on behalf of SMA and GACH opposed. In April 2021, the Enforcement Rece ivers applied for recognition of their appointment. In June 2021, LCL sought to consent to a claim brought by Cooper and McNally that includer a transfer of the shares of the Non Arena Companies (determined in the Directed Trial to be held for Dr Smith and payable to Confiscation Order) to SMA and GACH, which the Smith parties (including Mr Thomas) claimed were not controlled by the Enforcement Receivers but by Thomas or entities connected with them. In November 2021, Minardi Investments Limited (then actin g by Smith associates) brought a further claim against SMA (acting by the Enforcement Receivers). The opposition to recognition of the Enforcement Receivers and the outcome of the Directed Trial continues , resulting in significant delay and costs26. 25 Paragraph 5.7.2 of MR26 (pages 569-623, page 599) 26 Paragraphs 5.2.7 and 5.2.8 of MR26 (page 585-586).

A1.5/67 52 March 2022 ongoing Obstruction of vacant possession of Flats 11, 12, 19, 20 and 21 Hamilton House27 Certain of the LCL Parties Dr Smith, Robert Morris, Imogen Smith and Iona Smith, all parties to the LCL Settlement Agreement , were required to give vacant possession of these flats, pursuant to its terms. Despite notice being given to them by the Enforcement Receivers , vacant possession was actively resisted, including by way of court applications, causing significant cost and delay. As noted above, despite vacant possession having ultimately been obtained by the Enforcement Receivers, Dr Smith has again claimed rights over these properties, as a result of the PACCAR decision. 11 May 2022 Part 8 Claim commenced by Messrs Thomas and Taylor by which they sought to appoint Mr Ticehurst as trustee of the Harbour Trust for an improper purpose \u201cthe Part 8 Claim \u201d) Thomas As part of their efforts to frustrate the Directed Trial, Messrs Thomas and Taylor (with the support and funding of Smith and his associates) sought to enforce certain rights as trustees of the trust arising out of the Harbour Investment Agreement by way of a Part 8 claim . Despite a previous indication from Foxton J that Messrs Thomas and Taylor were not suitable trustees, given their prior unlawful receipt of trust funds, they acted in direct contravention of the Judge\u2019s indications by both seeking to act as trustees, and by improperly appointing a further trustee (Mr Ticehurst) . After a further trial which took place in late 2022, again in front of Foxton J, Messrs Thomas and Taylor were found to have been acting in concert with Smith and against the interests of the principal beneficiaries of the Harbour Trust, and were removed as trustees. All of Messrs Thomas and Taylors\u2019 arguments failed, the Settlement Parties were forced to incur significant additional costs of over \u00a31m, and the additional litigation caused a significant delay in the ongoing enforcement efforts of the Office Holders. 20 June 2022 Contempt Application against Mr Thomas The Enforcement Receivers filed a contempt application against Mr Thomas28 on the following grounds: \u2022 Inciting LCL to purport to transfer its shares in SMA and GACH to the \u201cjoint trustees of the Orb Claimants Trust \u201d; \u2022 Purporting to accept board appointments for SMA and GACH; and \u2022 Purporting to act as a director of SMA and GACH by agreeing to stay the RMI proceedings . 27 Please see footnote 7 of 4.3.1.2 of the 6th Receivership Order R eport dated 12 July 2024 ( pages 624-663, page 63 5) 28 Paragraph 4.2.12 of MR25 (pages 664 \u2013 716, page 67 9) A1.5/68 53 Ultimately, Mr Thomas carried out the actions required by the Enforcement Receivers, and the contempt application was compromised with costs ordered in favour of the Enforcement Receivers. 29 July 2022 29 July 2022 Dr Smith contempt of court conviction Dr Smith Dr Smith was convicted of contempt of court in July 2022 in respect of breaches of a restraint order obtained by the SFO, which restricted his access to certain bank accounts.

Foxton J rejected those efforts in a Judgment dated 28 February 2023 ([2023] EWHC 428 (Comm)) (the \u201cSMA Judgment \u201d) which found amongst other things that: \u201c19. I have no doubt that the approach taken by those behind Minardi and those behind BKV (to extent that they are different), was co -ordinated, and represented a calculated attempt to delay the hearing and the orders which the Harcus Parker Parties seek. Those individuals should be in no doubt as to the importance which the court attaches to ensuring that its processes are not misused and its orders are complied with, and the full range of the court's powers to serve these ends \u2026 103. As will be apparent from the foregoing, there is a real risk in this case that individuals who are bound by, but unhappy with, the outcome of the Directed Trial have been and are continuing to instigate proceedings and applications in these proceeding s and elsewhere to challenge the outcome of the Directed Trial or by way of a collateral attack on its conclusions. The scale of these activities and the legal costs and court time they are consuming, mean that considerable vigilance will be required on th e court's part to ensure that its judgments are respected and its processes are not abused. 104. If activities of this kind continue, there will need to be careful consideration of a number of matters, including: i) whether there are any individuals who may have breached court orders and undertakings and, if so, whether the court's committal jurisdiction should be engaged; 29 Paragraph 3.4.3 of MR 26 (page 581). The court\u2019s decision is summarised in this link: Convicted fraudster found to be in contempt of court - Serious Fraud Office (sfo.gov.uk) A1.5/69 54 ii) whether officers of the court should be given control of any companies which have changed hands in questionable circumstances, and which are being used in this process; iii) whether further injunctions could or should be granted against individuals where there is a sufficiently arguable case that they are engaged in activities intended to challenge a judgment which is binding upon them; iv) the consequences of undischarged costs orders in the litigation to date; and v) who has been funding these various applications and whether any orders against the funding parties or those controlling them would be appropriate. 31 January 2023 Assignment Application resulting in the Debarring/ Stay Order Thomas Despite Foxton J\u2019s clear direction regarding further collusion and frustration, Messrs Thomas and Taylor sought to bring a further application against Harbour and the other Settlement Parties in early 2023. This application sought an order for the assignment of claims to certain assets identified in the Consequentials Order, currently under the control of office holders.

Pursuant to a judgment dated 29 November 2023, Mr Thomas was held to have committed a contempt of court. August 2023 - ongoing Obstruction by Dr Cochrane and other Smith associates in respect of C\u2019an Agata and Son Montserrat (the \u201cSpanish Properties \u201d) Dr Cochrane Dr Smith Thomas Stickler Two subsidiaries of Buena Vida Living 2 B.V ( \u201cBVL2 \u201d), Conor and Agata, both hold registered title to the Spanish Properties. The Enforcement Receivers commenced eviction proceedings against Dr Cochrane and Mr Jansen (Dr Smith\u2019s associate who purportedly occupied the property pursuant to an agreement A1.5/70 55 with Dr Cochrane). This application succeeded in the Spanish Court in June 2023 and Dr Cochrane was ordered to pay 108,000 euros to Agata (the \"Spanish Judgment\"), but her eviction was automatically suspended whilst she appealed the Spanish Judgment. In the end, the Spanish Court acceded to the Receivers (as directors of Agata) submission that Dr Cochrane's appeal should be struck out which it was earlier this year. According to the Enforcement Receivers, Mr Thomas asserts that the shares of Agata and Conor (or their proceeds) are (in some way) the property of the \u201cOrb Claimants\u201d held for the Harbour Trust. A summary of the extensive correspondence from Dr Cochrane who threatens litigation in respect of the Spanish Properties30, is as follows: On 11 August 2023, Dr Cochrane wrote to Bernardo Oliver, an architect who is engaged by the Receivers (as directors of Conor) in connection with the sale of Son Monserrat, noting Mr Oliver\u2019s conversation earlier that day with Dr Smith and asserting: a. that the property and Conor are \u201chers\u201d following their lawful transfer to her pursuant to the terms of the Isle of Man Settlement (with 62.5% owned by her and 37.5% owned by Messrs Thomas and Taylor); b. that Will Besga of Mallorca Law SL (\u201cMallorca Law\u201d) and the Enforcement Receivers had conspired to forge a shareholder resolution to remove Gail Cochrane and Ms Stickler as joint directors of Conor and Agata without their consent, with such forgery having been reported to the Mallorcan authorities and Miguel Games of Pinto Rui z & Del Valle having been instructed to bring proceedings against Mr Besga for fraud; c. that Mr Besga and the Enforcement Receivers\u2019 actions in this regard were part of the wider \u201cstrategy of unlawful interference in the",

On 15 August 2023, Dr Smith wrote to the Receivers to assert that he had been \u201c asked to assist the Orb Claimants to finish the redevelopment of Son Monserrat and to refurbish C\u2019an Agata \u201d, to confirm that he had moved into C\u2019an Agata (without the Receivers\u2019 consent as directors of Agata) and to request that the Receivers \u201c cease orchestrating interference\u201d with Agata and Conor. 30 Paragraphs 4.6.10 to 4.6. 10.26 of MR24 (pages 717 \u2013 768, pages 73 7 - 742).

Conor, Agata and the Spanish Properties \" are the property of the Orb Claimants \"; b. \"the purported role that Mr Milsom and Standish [Standisch] hold was obtained by fraud because they were purportedly appointed as directors of the Companies by Will Besga (a Mollorca attorney) on the basis of a purported shareholder resolution he forged (se e attached letter of 11 April 2023).

The Enforcement Receivers provided robust responses to these letters on 21 August 2023. On 23 August 2023 (at 10.47am), Dr Cochrane wrote to the Enforcement Receivers alleging that their appointments as directors of Agata and Conor had occurred as a result of a forged shareholder resolution, suggesting that the Receivers\u2019 correspondence with her was \u201cbullying, threatening and demeaning\u201d and asserting that the PACCAR decision confirmed that the shares in Agata and Conor are the property of the Orb Claimants.

A1.5/74 59 Appendix 2 Background to Dr Cochrane\u2019s Jersey Recall Applications The Jersey Recall Applications I. Administration application 1 In the context of the Orb Claimants\u2019 failure to honour the terms of the Harbour IA, as addressed in the Directed Trial Judgment, Harbour issued formal demands in Jersey against Orb by letters dated 17 and 26 August 2016 (pages 771-779), and pursuant to these demands, Orb was informed that failing settlement, an application would be made for the appointment of an administrator. 2 Following the formal demand upon Orb referred to above, Harbour applied to the Royal Court of Jersey (the \u201c Royal Court \u201d) for a letter of request to the English High Court seeking an administration order in respect of Orb. The Royal Court's judgment on that application was dated 28 September 2016, Representation of Harbour v Orb [2016] JRC 171 (\u201c the Administration Judgment \u201d) (pages 780-795). 3 In paragraph 40 of the Administration J udgment, the Royal Court noted as follows: - \u201cIn her written responses to the formal demands made by Harbour, Dr Cochrane denies any debt being due by ORB to Harbour, although that denial is not repeated in her affidavit of 7th September, 2016, filed in response to Harbour\u2019s application. Indeed, and perhaps significantly, she says nothing in that affidavit about Harbour\u2019s claim or whether or not it is accepted by ORB. Furthermore, in his skeleton argument, Advocate Nicholls, representing ORB, makes no reference",

Indeed, and perhaps significantly, she says nothing in that affidavit about Harbour\u2019s claim or whether or not it is accepted by ORB. Furthermore, in his skeleton argument, Advocate Nicholls, representing ORB, makes no reference at all to Harbour\u2019s claim and whether or not it is accepted by ORB. His submissions are limited entirely to the lack of any evidence of ORB having assets within England and Wales, a requisite, he says, for any letter of request to be issued. Advocate Nicholls did not appear at the hearing on the 14th September, 2016, and therefore the Court was unable to press him on the point, but if ORB had a genuine defence to Harbour\u2019s claim, it would be surprising in the extreme for that defence not to be mentioned, and indeed, given some prominence.\u201d 4 The Royal Court concluded that Harbour was a creditor of Orb with a liquidated claim and that Orb was cash flow insolvent. It nevertheless decided in its discretion not to issue a letter of request on the ground that, given Orb\u2019s incorporation in Jersey an d other matters, a d\u00e9sastre would be the preferable way of proceeding, II. D\u00e9sastre application A1.5/75 60 5 Following the Administration Judgment, Harbour made a formal demand on Dr Cochrane under the terms of her personal guarantee of the obligations of Orb that I describe above. 6 It then applied for declarations of d\u00e9sastre in respect of both Orb and Dr Cochrane. The matter was heard inter partes on 24 November 2016. The Royal Court granted the applications on 24 November 2016 for the reasons set out in a judgment dated 12 January 2017, Harbour v Orb [2017] JRC 007 (\u201c the D\u00e9sastre Judgment \u201d) (pages 796-809). 7 The Royal Court reminded itself (at para graph 13 of the D\u00e9sastre Judgment) that, in order for the Court to declare a d\u00e9sastre , a creditor must show that it has a liquidated claim (i.e. a certain debt which is not the subject of a genuine dispute or an arguable defence) which exceeds the minimum threshold of \u00a33,000 and the creditor must also show that the debtor is insolvent (def ined as meaning \u2018an inability to pay its debts as they fall due\u2019 i.e. on a cash flow basis) but has realisable assets. The Court said that its judgment should be read as a continuation of the Admi nistration judgment. 8 As to whether Harbour was a creditor with a liquidated claim against Orb, at paragraphs 19 - 21 of the D\u00e9sastre Judgment , the Royal Court held: \u201c19. Advocate Drummond, for Harbour, took the Court through a careful analysis, set out in his skeleton argument, of how Harbour\u2019s liquidated claim arose under the Funding Agreement, the Isle of Man Agreement, and the 2014 Agreement, the latter presenti ng an insurmountable hurdle for ORB and Dr Cochrane in that by that Agreement, to which they were a party, they had agreed that the assets recovered by Dr Cochrane under the Isle of Man Agreement (at least \u00a310m) would be treated as proceeds of the English proceedings Harbour had been funding, giving rise to an immediate liability on the part of ORB to repay the sums advanced, namely \u00a35,189,010.48, just short of the aggregate amount Harbour was committed to fund under the funding agreement.\u201d 9 The Court held that Harbour was indisputably owed",

It further held that Dr Cochrane had no reasonably arguable defence to the claim against her in this sum pursuant to her guarantee. 10 Having found that Orb had realisable assets, the Royal Court considered the position of Dr Cochrane at paragraph 32 of its judgment in the following terms: \u201cIn or around April 2016, Dr Cochrane signed a loan note in favour of Phoenix Group Foundation (\u201cPhoenix\u201d) in the sum of \u00a373.75m in which she represents that she is the ultimate owner of a number of A1.5/76 61 assets set out in Schedule 1 thereto. She also said in her affidavit of 7th September 2016, \u201cI am also privileged to be a very wealthy woman, with holdings in dozens of companies worldwide, including [ORB].\u201d 11 The Royal Court was satisfied that Dr Cochrane and Orb had realisable assets despite the appearance of a strategy to divert assets away from Orb. 12 The Court then considered a submission that Orb had a counterclaim against Harbour in relation to the Harbour IA which it was entitled to set off against any debt owed to Harbour. In this connection the Royal Court said as follows: \u201c44. If this was a genuine claim for \u00a373M, then it was inconceivable to us that no reference had been made to it in the previous proceedings before this Court, in which Dr Cochrane did file an affidavit (which made no reference to it) or at any time at all in the dealings between Orb and Dr Cochrane on the one part and Harbour on the other. It was inconceivable to us that, if the claim was genuine, Orb and Dr Cochrane were unable to give particulars of it sufficient to enable us to assess whether it was re asonably arguable. Furthermore, there was no explanation as to how such a substantial claim came to be filed before the High Court without legal advice a mere two days before the hearing. 45. These arguments had been put forward by Orb and Dr Cochrane at the last moment without any evidence being filed in support on their behalf. In our view, given the background of this matter, we would have expected at least an affidavit from Dr Cochrane to assist us in the exercise of our discretion, an affidavit upon which she would, of course, have been susceptible to cross -examination. She gave us no such assistance.\u201d 13 The Court concluded that to refuse or adjourn the applications for declarations of d\u00e9sastre would be unjust to Harbour and the other creditors. 14 Having regard for various other considerations , the Court held that the requirements for granting a declaration of d\u00e9sastre were met in respect of both Orb and Dr Cochrane and accordingly, on 24 November 2016, the Royal Court declared Orb and Dr Cochrane en d\u00e9sastre (pages 810-817). a. Events following the declaration en d\u00e9sastre 15 On 30 December 2016, Harbour filed a proof of debt in each of Orb and Dr Cochrane's respective d\u00e9sastres (pages 818-847).

Events following the declaration en d\u00e9sastre 15 On 30 December 2016, Harbour filed a proof of debt in each of Orb and Dr Cochrane's respective d\u00e9sastres (pages 818-847). Those proofs of debt have not yet been adjudicated by the Viscount. A1.5/77 62 16 The Viscount applied to the Royal Court to issue two letters of request to the English Court. Despite what Dr Cochrane had said in her affidavit for the bankruptcy hearing (pages 848-853), the Royal Court noted in its judgment of 16 February 2017 (pages 854- 858) (giving reasons for issuing those letters of request) that (paragraph 9): \"\u2026 Dr Cochrane has now asserted to the Viscount that she has very few assets. According to her recently completed personal questionnaire and statement of income and expenditure required under Article 18 of the Law, Dr Cochrane has advised that her only as sets consist of six pieces of jewellery, two shares in a company known as Bodega Limited (\u201cBodega\u201d) and an unknown value in a partnership, which the Viscount believes is a share in the medical practice from which she works. Other items of value currently in her possession, which include a substantial art and wine collection, a rib, several high -value motor vehicles and other chattels are said to be owned by Bodega, of which the 99.9% shareholder is said to be Litigation Capital Funding, a New York based en tity believed to be owned by Mr Anthony Smith, the brother of Dr Gerald Smith. Dr Smith is the former husband of Dr Cochrane and has twice been convicted of offences of fraud and served a prison sentence. Dr Smith has advised the Viscount that Orb does n ot have nor has it ever had any assets.\" 17 The judgment further noted that (paragraph 13): \"Following the declarations en d\u00e9sastre, creditors had submitted claims, together with supporting documents, against Dr Cochrane in the sum of \u00a3765,532,125 and against Orb in the sum of \u00a3562,889,913. The Viscount believes there is potentially some degree of duplication in the claims as some creditors have claimed against Dr Cochrane as guarantor of the obligations of Orb. Nevertheless, given the background described in the September judgment and the judgment of Popplewell J and the other matters referred t o above, the Viscount regards it as inconceivable that both Dr Cochrane and Orb have been able to acquire such colossal levels of debt without owning any of the assets listed by Harbour in its application for d\u00e9sastre. The Viscount also notes that Dr Coch rane and Orb are subject to ongoing and vigorously fought legal proceedings in England. Five such sets of proceedings are listed in her affidavit.\" b. Application for a retrospective extension of time to appeal 18 On 31 December 2019, Dr Cochrane applied for an extension of time in which to appeal against the declaration of d\u00e9sastre in her case (pages 859-863). This application first came before Birt JA as a single judge on 14 January 2020, who directed that the matter be brought to the full court (page 86 4). Dr Cochrane\u2019s application was subsequently listed for hearing during the week commencing 27 July 2020. A1.5/78 63 19 On 16 July 2020, Dr Cochrane applied for an adjournment, substantially on the basis that she had a short while earlier dismissed Advocate Blakeley and was planning to instruct a new firm of advocates (pages 865-867).",

Dr Cochrane\u2019s application was subsequently listed for hearing during the week commencing 27 July 2020. A1.5/78 63 19 On 16 July 2020, Dr Cochrane applied for an adjournment, substantially on the basis that she had a short while earlier dismissed Advocate Blakeley and was planning to instruct a new firm of advocates (pages 865-867). That application for an adjournment was refused by the Court of Appeal in a short judgment dated 20 July 2020 (Cochrane v Harbour Fund II LLP and the Viscount [2020] JCA 140A) (pages 868-872). The new firm was not in fact instructed and accordingly Dr Cochrane appeared as a litigant in person at the hearing. 20 On Friday 24 July 2020 \u2013 the matter being listed for hearing on Tuesday 28 July 2020 \u2013 Dr Cochrane sent to the Court an affidavit dated 23 July 2020 (pages 873-880) together with various exhibits. By a letter dated 27 July 2020 (pages 881-883), she purported to file two further documents. Her application to adduce those documents was rejected (pages 884- 920). 21 The Court of Appeal also noted that (paragraph 100): \"As to creditors, the Viscount states that the current value of claims in Dr Cochrane\u2019s d\u00e9sastre is approximately \u00a3304,293,400, albeit that she has not yet adjudicated upon the claims because she considers it unfair to put potential creditors to the cost o f proving their claims in circumstances where the current English litigation is likely to result in the effective adjudication of many of these claims and where, pending the outcome of those proceedings, the present assets are insufficient to lead to any d istribution.\" 22 The application for an extension of time was dismissed, the Jersey Court of Appeal finding: \"104. \u2026 Given the extremely lengthy delay (nearly three years), and our conclusion that the reasons given for that delay do not provide justification, we would only consider extending the time for appealing if the merits of the proposed appeal were overwhe lming (to use Beloff JA\u2019s expression). That is certainly not the case. As we have described earlier, we conclude that there are minimal prospects of Dr Cochrane being successful in showing that Harbour does not have a liquidated contractual claim in debt , or that she did not have realisable assets at the time of the d\u00e9sastre application. Even in relation to whether Harbour has a proprietary claim to the assets which are the subject of the current English litigation, any case mounted on appeal would be at best arguable; it is certainly not overwhelming. 105. The above factors are sufficient to lead to a rejection of this application. But when one adds in the factor that prejudice would be caused to Harbour and other parties if the application were to be allowed, the case for refusing to extend the time for appealing is unanswerable.\" A1.5/79 64 23 In a separate costs judgment, the Jersey Court of Appeal awarded costs against Dr Cochrane on the indemnity basis (pages 921-924). In respect of her application for an extension of time, it stated: \"7. In our judgment, the Applicant\u2019s conduct in pursuing the Application was unreasonable and takes the case out of the norm. We so conclude for the following reasons: (i) The delay was extreme (nearly 3 years when the time for appealing is 28 days) in circumstances where this Court found that there was no justification for this period of delay.

As the Court said at paragraph 104 of its judgment, this alone was s ufficient to lead to dismissal of the Application unless the merits of any appeal were overwhelming. (ii) The period of delay and the inaction by the Applicant has also to be judged against the fact that, to the Applicant\u2019s knowledge, administration of the d\u00e9sastre was continuing throughout this period. (iii) Not only was there extreme delay without justification but this Court found that the prospects of success of any appeal were minimal and that its pursuit would cause prejudice not only to Harbour but also to other parties to the current English litigation, who had all proceeded and incurred time and expense on the basis that the Applicant was en d\u00e9sastre and that the Viscount was accordingly entitled to act on her behalf. 24 Putting these matters together, we consider that pursuit of the Application was unreasonable and that it would not be a fair result for Harbour only to be able to recover the costs which it has incurred on the standard basis.\" 25 As to the other applications, the Court of Appeal said (at paragraph 11) \"In our judgment, the conduct of the Applicant both in relation to the adjournment application and the last minute applications for fresh evidence was unreasonable and justifies an aw ard of indemnity costs.\" c. Extension of Dr Cochrane's bankruptcy 26 On 14 January 2021, the Royal Court granted an application by the Viscount to extend Dr Cochrane's bankruptcy for three years (to 24 November 2023), for the reasons set out in a judgment dated 29 January 2021 (pages 925-930). The Royal Court noted that: \"3. The Viscount has taken control or possession of certain realisable assets of Dr Cochrane valued at approximately \u00a375,000 and believes that Dr Cochrane also owns further realisable assets, including an interest in certain Jersey properties and movable p roperty located therein, and shares in various other A1.5/80 65 companies. However, the ownership of such further assets of Dr Cochrane is currently the subject of proceedings in the High Court of England and Wales (CL -2017-000323) (\u201cthe English Proceedings\u201d). The English proceedings are highly complex, involving 47 parties and numerous personal and proprietary claims. They are summarised in the judgment of the Court in Viscount v Smith [2020] JRC 043. \u2026 7. The claims filed by potential creditors in Dr Cochrane\u2019s d\u00e9sastre total \u00a3305,261,798.37. Due to the ongoing English Proceedings, the Viscount has not yet conducted an inspection of the creditors\u2019 claims, nor has she formally adjudicated or admitted any of them. The Viscount considers that there is no utility in adjudicating any of the creditors\u2019 claims until the present uncertainty is resolved as to whether, and to what extent, there may be any assets available for distribution in the d\u00e9sastre. In her view, it is also unfair to put the creditors to the cost of proving their claims in circumstances where the English Proceedings are likely to result in the effective adjudication of many of their claims, and there are presently no assets available for distribution.\" d.

Further application for a (retrospective) application for an extension of time to appeal 27 On 16 August 2023, Dr Cochrane sent an application to the Jersey Court of Appeal seeking an extension of time to appeal against the declarations en d\u00e9sastre of both Dr Cochrane and Orb on the basis that the PACCAR Decision rendered the Harbour IA unlawful and unenforceable (pages 931-933). On 18 August 2023, Harbour confirmed that it intended to oppose this very late, retrospective application for an extension of time (page 934). 28 As far as we are aware, no directions have been given by the Court of Appeal for the resolution of this application, if indeed it is still being pursued by Dr Cochrane. e. Further application for an extension of the bankruptcy 29 On 3 October 2023, the Viscount issued an application for the further extension of Dr Cochrane's bankruptcy for a further three years (to 24 November 2027) (pages 935-964), resulting in an order of the Jersey Court dated 6 October 2023, convening a substantive hearing ( pages 96 5-969). 30 However, on 27 October 2023, the Viscount and Dr Cochrane agreed to the terms of a consent order that the hearing of that extension application be adjourned until after the determination of any recall application issued by Dr Cochrane (pages 970-971). A1.5/81 66 31 I understand from Harbour\u2019s Jersey lawyer, Advocate Edward Drummond, that irrespective of the outcome of the Viscount's application to extend the bankruptcy of Dr Cochrane, Orb will remain in bankruptcy; the provisions of Articles 39 to 42 of the Bankruptcy ( D\u00e9sastre ) (Jersey) Law 1990 only apply to individuals and do not apply to companies. f. Recall Application 32 On 21 November 2023, Dr Cochrane issued a representation seeking the recall of the declarations en d\u00e9sastre made in respect of her estate and the estate of Orb pursuant to Article 7 of the D\u00e9sastre (Bankruptcy) (Jersey) Law 1990 on the basis that they are both currently balance sheet solvent, with very small (or zero) claims against them, but with assets valued in the tens of millions of pounds. I understand from Harbour\u2019s Jersey lawyers, Bedell Cristin, that a recall petition such as this is adjudicated on the basis of the petitioner\u2019s balance sheet solvency as at the date of the application. Harbour\u2019s position is that Dr Cochrane has misrepresented both the nature of the assets which the Court should take into account (most of which belong to Orb, or were subject to the LCL Settlement I refer to above) as well the value of those assets, which she has grossly inflated. Additionally, Harbour contends that Dr Cochrane has also misrepre sented the liability position insofar as the claims of Harbour and other creditors are concerned. 33 On 1 December 2023, the representation was adjourned to a convening hearing on 6 February 202 4. On that date, for the reasons given in a judgment of the Royal Court dated 23 February 2024 (pages 972-976), the Viscount was convened to the application. Dr Cochrane was given leave to file an Amended Representation (which she did, dated 7 February 2024 (pages 977-991) and she also filed a further affidavit in support (her Third Affidavit sworn on 11 March 2024), which was served on creditors (pages 34 8 \u2013",

The Court set out a timetable for the filling of further evidence A1.5/82 67 and submissions from Harbour, Dr Cochrane and the Viscount. Accordingly, on 2 August 2024 Harbour filed its further evidence (pages 1011-1018), and the Viscount subsequently filed evidence in respect of Dr Cochrane\u2019s assertions regarding her asset and debt position on 8 and 2 3 August 2024 (pages 1019-1055). Dr Cochrane f iled responsive evidence on 10 September 202 4 (pages 105 6-1062). A1.5/83",

INTRODUCTION 1. I am a Partner in the law firm Marriott Harrison LLP (\u201cMH\u201d) of the above address . MH acts for Mr Nicholas Thomas in relation to the applications referred to in paragraph 2 below . 2. I make this witness statement : 2.1. In response to an application dated 31 October 2024 by Harbour Fund II, LP (\u201cHarbour \u201d) (the \u201c Harbour Application \u201d) and the 20th witness statement of Mr Adam Zoubir dated 31 October 2024 (\u201c Zoubir 20 \u201d) filed and served in support of it; and 2.2. In support of Mr Thomas\u2019 cross -application (the \u201c Thomas Cross- Application \u201d). The Harbour Application and the Thomas Cross -Application each seek mirror image declaratory and consequential relief relating to the enforceability of key parts of the Harbour Investment Agreement dated 10 July 2013 (the \u201c Harbour IA \u201d) in the wake of the decision of the Supreme Court in R (on the application of PACCAR Inc & Ors) v Competition Appeal Tribunal & Ors [2023] UKSC 28 (\u201c PACCAR \u201d) (together, the \u201cEnforceability Applications \u201d). 3. Specifically : 3.1. By the Harbour Application, Harbour seeks \u201cdirections, declarations and other relief \u201d in the terms of a draft order filed and served by Harbour with the Harbour Application , the principal e ffect of which (if granted) would be that Harbour could rely on and enforce all of the rights and interests purportedly granted to it under the Harbour IA and Mr Thomas would be prevented from challenging the same . A1.6/100 3 3.2. The Thomas Cross -Application seeks , essentially , the reverse relief, most notably a declaration or declarations to the effect that key parts of the Harbour IA is /are not enforceable by Harbour against the funded parties thereunder, including Mr Thomas, together with any consequential relief as may be appropriate , principally in the terms of the draft order provided with the accompanying a pplication notice . The Thomas Cross -Application is made pursuant to paragraph 27 of the Order of Mr Justice Foxton dated 11 June 2021 (the \u201c Consequentials Order \u201d) (page 12 ). 4. I am duly authorised by Mr Thomas to make this witness statement in opposition to the Harbour Application and in support of the Thomas Cross -Application . In both respects, and as necessary, this witness statement respond to matters set out in Zoubir 20 . However, for the avoidance of doubt, this statement does not engage in a line -by-line response to Zoubir 20.

Both Mr Thomas and Harbour are existing parties to these proceedings. My firm does not presently act for any other party. 6. The facts and matters set out in this statement are within my own knowledge, unless the contrary is expressly stated.

First, I summarise Mr Thomas\u2019 position on the Enforceability Applica tions, together with some high-level observations in relation to the contents of this witne ss statement and Zoubir 20 (Section B); A1.6/101 4 8.2. Second, I set out t he essential background to the Enforceability Application s (Section C); 8.3. Third, I set out t he key terms of the Harbour IA insofar as they are relevant to the Enforceability Application s (in particular, the Thomas Cross -Application) (Section D); 8.4. Fourth, I explain t he correspondence between MH (on Mr Thomas\u2019 behalf) and Harcus Parker LLP (\u201cHarcus Parker \u201d) (on behalf of Harbour ) about the enforceability of the Harbour IA , the culmination of which is a dispute about the enforceability of key aspects of the Harbour IA which now takes expression in the form of the issued Enforceability Applications (Section E); 8.5. Fifth, I address t he grounds on which Mr Thomas contends that key parts of the Harbour IA is/are unenforceable by Harbour (Section F), and why Harbour\u2019s severance argument s addressed (to some extent) in Zoubir 20 and its pre -action correspondence with my firm are wrong (Section G); 8.6. Sixth, I set out Mr Thomas\u2019 position in relation to Harbour\u2019s additional arguments , disconnected from the merits of Mr Thomas\u2019 application, that: (i) the Thomas Cross -Application and Mr Thomas\u2019 resistance to the Harbour Application should each be dismissed in toto as an abuse of the Court\u2019s process and/or by the application of a form of \u201cestoppel \u201d, and/or (ii) the Thomas Cross - Application (but, by contrast , and somehow, not the reverse application which Harbour has made ) is time -barred pursuant to the Limitation Act 1980 (Sectio n H); and 8.7. Lastly, I summarise t he form of declaration(s)/order(s) the parties invite the Court to make on the Enforceability Applications (Section I). 9. In doing so, I do not rehearse in full or seek to limit the detailed legal submissions which Mr Thomas will make in due course about these or other matters arising for determination by the Court in relation to the Enforceability Applications .

In doing so, I do not rehearse in full or seek to limit the detailed legal submissions which Mr Thomas will make in due course about these or other matters arising for determination by the Court in relation to the Enforceability Applications . A1.6/102 5 B. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND SCOPE OF THIS STATEMENT (1) Mr Thomas\u2019 position in summary 10. Notwithstanding various attempts by Harbour in Zoubir 20 to complicate the m by reference to tangential or purely prejudicial issues, the Enforceability Applications relate , at their core, to narrow and technical questions of law relating to the enforceability of the Harbour IA . Mr Thomas \u2019 position on those issues, and the other issues raised in Zoubir 20, is set out in summary form in this section . 11. It is clear (and agreed by Harbour) that at least part of the Harbour IA is a damages -based agreement (\u201c DBA \u201d) for the purposes of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (the \u201cCLSA 1990 \u201d) and, therefore, the DBA has to comply with certain provisions of the CLSA 1990 and the Damages Based Regulations (SI 2013/609) (the \u201cDBA Regs 2013 \u201d). In particular, Harbour admits that the Harbour IA (or the relevant part of it) meets the first two criteria for a DBA under the CLSA 1990 (Zoubir 20, \u00a7\u00a775 -76). Although Harbour does not expressly accept that the Harbour IA meets the third criterion , \u00a780 of Zoubir 20 confirms that Harbour does not contend that the Harbour I A (or the relevant part of it) meets the regulatory requirements for DBAs . 12. Zoubir 20 does not address the other breaches identified by Mr Thomas in pre -action correspondence. However, it is clear that the DBA in this case is roundly non -compliant with the requirements of the CLSA 1990 and/or the DBA Regs 2013 for the reasons explained below . 13. It is common ground that, to the extent the Harbour IA is a DBA and is non -compliant with the relevant legislation, that DBA is not enforceable by Harbour unless Harbour can sever the offending provisions. For the reasons set out below, Mr Thomas\u2019 position is that Harbour\u2019s severance arguments are wrong and, as a result, the DBA part of the Harbour IA is unenforceable by Harbour against \u201c the Claimants \u201d. 14. If the Thomas Cross -Application succeeds, Mr Thomas seeks the relief set out in the draft order provided in support of it, notably: A1.6/103 6 14.1. Declaratory relief as to the non-enforceability of key parts of the Harbour IA . 14.2. Consequential declaratory relief concerning Harbour\u2019s (non -)interest in any part of the Proceeds (as defined in the Harbour IA) and/or any payment under or in relation to the Harbour IA . 14.3. Any v ariations to the Consequentials Order to give effect to the foregoing matters as may be appropriate ; and 14.4. Any other relief the Court thinks fit. (2) Harbour\u2019s other arguments , satellite issues, and purported reservations of rights 15. Harbour raise s a plethora of points in Zoubir 20 which have nothing to do with the legal issues highlighted above and are an attempt by Harbour either t o prevent the Court from determining the enforceability question put before it \u2013 including by Harbour on its own application \u2013 or to delay Mr Thomas\u2019 access to the Court in having the Enforceability Applications determined and vindicating his substantive rights. 16. These other points fall broadly into three categories . First, Harbour relies on various legal",

These other points fall broadly into three categories . First, Harbour relies on various legal arguments as to why Mr Thomas is allegedly not entitled to challenge the enforceability of the Harbour IA on the grounds of (i) accusations of abuse of process ; (ii) \u201cestoppel or similar principles \u201d, including estoppel by deed ; and (iii) vague limitatio n arguments . 17. Second, Harbour relies on or raises a series of procedural reasons for debarring or delaying Mr Thomas from defending the Harbour Application and proceeding with the Thomas Cross -Application . These include : 17.1. Reliance on the so -called \u2018Debarring/Directions Order\u2019 of Mr Justice Foxton referred to in Zoubir 20 at \u00a715-21, which Mr Zoubir suggests may even be relevant to \u201c the relief sought by Mr Thomas \u201d (and , in Zoubir 20 at \u00a731, purports to reserve Harbour\u2019s rights) . He does not explain what relevance this is alleged to have to the relief Mr Thomas seeks or why it is appropriate merely for A1.6/104 7 Harbour to reserve any rights it has in this regard . 17.2. A procedural point concerning out of time appeal s (Zoubir 20, \u00a724). I note that Mr Zoubir stops short of positively contending that this Court is not capable of determining the issues on the Enforceability Applications . This appears to be a further attempt to preserve an argument for later in the event that Harbour\u2019s arguments of principle fail. 17.3. Harbour\u2019s proposed approach to case management (not previously made known to Mr Thomas) , including a n unnecessary two-staged approach to the issues, without providing an y good reason why dividing the issues between the parties would be proportionate or efficient in this case (Zoubir 20, \u00a7\u00a722 -23). 18. Third , Mr Zoubir purports to reserve Harbour\u2019s right to raise further arguments at some unspecified point in the future . Mr Zoubir gives some \u201c examples \u201d at \u00a7147 of Zoubir 20: \u201cThese include, for example: (a) [...] whether Harbour can hold Dr Cochrane , Mr Thomas and Mr Taylor liable for breach of the representations and warranties at Cl 3.1(g) of the Harbour IA under which they promised that the obligations assumed were \u201clegal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations\u201d in the amount of any reduction to Harbour\u2019s entitlement; (b) whether Harbour can nevertheless uphold its rights on alternative bases, such as proprietary estoppel, constructive or resulting trusts, unjust enrichment or equitable allowance, or the survival of the Harbour Trust even in the event that the Harbour I A is found to be unenforceable in whole or in part; and (c) the impact of any of these determinations on the position of other parties to the proceedings .\u201d (emphasis added) 19. No explanation is given by Mr Zoubir for why this approach would be appropriate, proportionate, and consistent with the overriding objective and the principle of finality . 20. Mr Thomas \u2019 position is that it is not appropriate for Harbour, via Zoubir 20 or at all , to raise grounds on which it wishes to pursue the Harbour Application and/or defend the Thomas Cross -Application that are not properly explain ed (now). For example: 20.1. Harbour \u2019s argument that Mr Thomas is \u201cbarred by doctrines of",

Mr Thomas \u2019 position is that it is not appropriate for Harbour, via Zoubir 20 or at all , to raise grounds on which it wishes to pursue the Harbour Application and/or defend the Thomas Cross -Application that are not properly explain ed (now). For example: 20.1. Harbour \u2019s argument that Mr Thomas is \u201cbarred by doctrines of estoppel or similar principles \u201d from vindicating his rights , appears to be an attempt to open up an issue or issues but (i) not to explain which forms of estoppel are relied A1.6/105 8 upon (beyond estoppel by deed ) and the legal and factual bases for applying them to the Enforceability Applications , and (ii) to widen Harbour\u2019s potential argument even further by reference to principles \u201c similar \u201d to estoppel (whatever that is intended to mean). I also note that MH sought clarification about this pre- action correspondence but Harbour has failed to provide this : for example, see MH\u2019s letter of 23 August 2024 (\u00a7\u00a75 -8) (pages 809 -811); Harcus Parker\u2019s response dated 9 September 2024 (\u00a73) (page 817 ); MH\u2019s further letter dated 25 September 2024 (\u00a7\u00a7 5-7) (page 822 ); and Harcus Parker\u2019s response dated 9 October 2024 (\u00a7\u00a72 -3) (page 829 ). 20.2. Harbour now raises two possible limitation argument s (a six -year period or alternatively laches) but has failed to articulate how they are said to apply in this case. 20.3. Harbour confirms that it accepts (as indeed it must) the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in PACCAR . It also concedes, as above, the application of the first limb of the test in s.58AA(3) of the CLSA 1990 (Zoubir 20, \u00a775) . However, it also purports to reserve its right to challenge \u201cany other point [which] ultimately had to be determined by the Supreme Court \u201d (Zoubir 20, \u00a775) (by which Mr Zoubir presumably means in relation to the first limb of the CLSA 1990 test).1 Mr Zoubir does not explain what is meant by this and I respectfully suggest it is not open to Harbour to decline to take (or indeed explain) points that it intends to rely on in relation to the PACCAR decision . 21. I am concerned that the above points may be developed as late as the provision of a skeleton argument shortly before the substantive hearing of the Enforceability Applications , when Mr Thomas will not have a fair opportunity to respond to them . Again, I believe, respectfully, that, unless and to the extent the above arguments are explained properly in its respons ive evidence , Harbour should not be allowed to rely on them at the hearing of the Enforceability Applications . 1 Harbour takes a similar approach to the Blue Pencil Test (as defined in Zoubir 20 at \u00a7122.1) : see fn.23 of Zoubir 20. A1.6/106 9 (3) Other m atters not covered in this statement 22. For completeness, I also wish to highlight that large parts of Zoubir 20 are not relevant to the substance of the Enforceability A pplications . Where that is the case, and without admission, I do not respond to the m in the interests of brevity and relevance. 23. These issues include (but are not necessarily limited to): 23.1. Mr Zoubir\u2019s account of events after the Directed Trial for example, but without limitation, Section D (\u00a7\u00a749-51 of Zoubir 20 ); 23.2.

Alleged events and arguments concerni ng parties other than Mr Thomas : e.g., Section s E and L , and Section G (insofar as it is concerned with the so -called \u2018LCL Settlement\u2019 ) of Zoubir 20 ; 23.3. Purely case management issues (e.g. Zoubir 20 at \u00a7\u00a7 22-23); 23.4. Matters concerning the so -called \u2018Debarring/Directions Order\u2019 (e.g. Zoubir 20 at \u00a715 and \u00a7\u00a717 -21); and 23.5. Other seemingly irrelevant issues, such as Harbour\u2019s alleged \u201c reliance \u201d on the Harbour IA ( e.g. Zoubir 20, Section J) . 24. I also note that attempts have been made in Zoubir 20 to elide the actions of Dr Smith and/or Cochrane with that of Mr Thomas (for example in the entirety of Section D of Zoubir 20 ), by use of the defined term , \u201cthe Smith Parties \u201d throughout . This is an unhelpful, tendentious , and potentially misleading use of definitional language . Mr Thomas\u2019 position is explained in some more detail in his witness statement filed in connection with the Enforceability Applications . 25. Finally, I note \u00a7\u00a724-31 of Zoubir 20 concerning the possibility of an appeal from the Directed Trial Judgment. Mr Thomas\u2019 position is that this Court can give the necessary relief sought in the Thomas Cross -Application, and indeed (although it is resisted) on the Harbour Application under the liberty to apply provision at \u00a727 of the Consequentials A1.6/107 10 Order as explained below (page 12 ). Harbour appears at least to agree with the latter proposition (that the Court can give relief on the Harbour Application) , and I respectfully suggest it applies to both Enforceability Applications. C. ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND 26. The underlying background to th e Original Proceedings (defined below) in relation to which the Harbour IA was entered into is so substantial and peripheral to the enforceability issue that I do not consider it practicable or proportionate to rehearse all of it here . Zoubir 20 adopts the same approach. Therefore, I have set out below only the key factual and procedural background to the Enforceability Applications . (1) The Original Proceedings and Harbour IA2 The underlying dispute 27. The original litigation against a Mr Andrew Ruhan (\u201cMr Ruhan \u201d) (claim number CL - 2012 -00625) concerned claims to recover funds from Mr Ruhan in connection with an alleged property -related profit -sharing agreement (the \u201c Original Proceedings \u201d). 28. The genesis of the dispute in the Original Proceedings was the dealings between two businessmen, Dr Gerald Smith (\u201c Dr Smith \u201d) and Mr Ruhan. Dr Smith had previously been convicted of theft from a company pension fund and served two years\u2019 imprisonment, and was later convicted of theft of a further (approximately) \u00a335 million from Izodia PLC (\u201c Izodia \u201d) (the \u201c Izodia Theft \u201d) for which he served a further eight years in prison.3 29. Orb A.R.L (\u201c Orb\u201d) was the First Claimant in the Original Proceedings . Mr Roger Taylor and Mr Thomas were the other Claimant s (together, the \u201c Orb Claimants \u201d). At the time of the Original Proceedings, the shares in Orb were held by a company as trustee of a 2 Save where specified below, I take the information underpinning this summary from the Judgment of Mr Justice Popplewell (as he",

Of the c.\u00a335m stolen, around \u00a32.8m was returned , leaving c.\u00a332.2m due to Izodia.4 In the end, the Serious Fraud Office (\u201c SFO \u201d) obtained a Confiscation Order against Dr Smith in the sum of approximately \u00a341m . 31. During the early part of 2003, negotiations took place between Dr Smith on the one hand, and Mr Ruhan and a Mr Campbell on the other hand, resulting in an agreement for the sale of various of Orb\u2019s assets to Mr Ruhan and companies associated with and/or controlled by him (the \u201c Orb Assets \u201d). The nature of the Orb Assets is set out in para graph 9 of the 2016 Judgment (page 24 ). 32. Mr Thomas and others alleged in the Original Proceedings that there was a further, oral agreement reached at a meeting between Dr Smith, Mr Taylor, Mr Ruhan and Mr Campbell on 6 May 2003, pursuant to which the Orb Parties (being the Claimants in the 2012 Proceedings plus Dr Cochrane and SMA Investment Holdings Limited (\u201c SMA \u201d)) alleged that it was agreed ( inter alia ) that Mr Ruhan would redevelop, restructure, manage and/or dispose of various of the Orb Assets , and he would pay Orb, Mr Taylor and Mr Thoma s, in agreed proportions , certain percentages of the profits of various of the Orb Assets. Mr Ruhan denie d any such oral agreement. 33. Thereafter, the Orb Assets were transferred by Mr Ruhan into a complex structure involving various companies ultimately owned by the trustee of an Isle of Man settlement (the \u201c Arena Settlement \u201d). There were over 100 companies within the Are na Settlement . 34. Mr Justice Popplewell explained the structure of the Arena Settlement in the following terms at [20] -[25] of his 2016 Judgment: 34.1. The trustee held the assets through its 100% shareholding in each of six holding companies. It was the shares in these six holding companies which were 4 2016 Judgment, \u00a78 (page 23 ). A1.6/109 12 transferred to SMA under the IOM Settlement (explained below) . Four of those holding companies were Glen Moar Properties Ltd (\u201c Glen Moar \u201d), Sulby Investment Holdings Ltd (\u201c Sulby \u201d), Ballaugh Holdings Ltd (\u201c Ballaugh \u201d) and Unicorn Worldwide Holdings Ltd (\u201c Unicorn \u201d); 34.2. Those holding companies in turn were parent companies of groups of other companies (see [22] -[24] of the 2016 Judgment); and 34.3. Glen Moar, Sulby, Ballaugh, and Unicorn were incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and in March 2015 were each put into liquidation. The appointed liquidators were partners of Quantuma LLP (\u201cQuantuma",

Glen Moar, Sulby, Ballaugh, and Unicorn were incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and in March 2015 were each put into liquidation. The appointed liquidators were partners of Quantuma LLP (\u201cQuantuma \u201d). 35. Mr Ruhan (eventually) admitted5 that he was at all material times the ultimate beneficiary of the Arena Settlement by virtue of his former solicitors and advis ers, Mr Simon Cooper and Mr Simon McNally, who held the interest as nominee for him. Mr Ruhan also contended that he was in ultimate control of all of the companies within the Arena Settlement. 36. On 27 October 2012, shortly after Dr Smith\u2019s release from prison in connection with the Izodia The ft, the Original Proceedings were commenced by the Orb Claimants . In essence, they alleged that , in breach of the oral agreement reached in May 2003 and Mr Ruhan\u2019s fiduciary duties, Mr Ruhan had (i) sought to conceal the Orb Assets in the complex structure of the Arena Settlement, (ii) sold them for his own benefit, and (iii) failed to account for the share of the profits due under the oral agreement . The funding position 37. The Harbour IA was entered into on 10 July 2013 between Harbour and the Orb Claimants. A copy of the Harbour IA is at pages 280-374. 38. The purpose of the Harbour IA was for Harbour to provide litigation funding to the Orb Claimants to fund the Original Proceedings against Mr Ruhan, involving t he causes of 5 Formally in the Original Proceedings. A1.6/110 13 action referred to in Schedule 1 of the Harbour IA (page 305 ), defined as: \u201cEach and every claim that the Claimants may seek to assert against the Defendant or any other person, arising out of or related to an agreement concluded on 6 May 2003 between the Claimants and the Defendant, whereby the Defendant agreed to pay or procure to be paid to the Claimants an agreed percentage of any profits accruing to the Defendant directly or indirectly from the future sale of certain real property whic h the First Claimant had transferred to the Defendant on or about the same date and includes any and all statutory, legal or equitable cause or causes of action, whether to be made in [England and Wales] or in any other jurisdiction that are or may be vest ed in the Claimants or its Affiliates against the Defendant or any other person, arising out of or related to the said agreement .\u201d 39. Harbour agreed under the Harbour IA to provide the Orb Claimants funding of c. \u00a35.28 million to meet their legal costs in the Original Proceedings: see the Directed Trial Judgment (defined below) at \u00a771 (page 88 ). I note Mr Zoubir gives a figure of \u00a35,189,010.48 at para. 10 of his Affidavit dated 18 June 2024 (page 377 ) in respect of sums actually advanced. 40. As set out in more detail below, the Harbour IA provided for Harbour to receive ( inter alia) a percentage of the value of the Proceeds (as defined in the Harbour IA and below) of the Original Proceedings, including from any settlement of those proceedings, and (as also explained in more detail below) created (under Clause 8) the Harbour Trust (defined below and in the Harbour IA) under which the Orb Claimants were to",

The IOM Settlement 41. During the Original Proceedings , in March 2014, Dr Cochrane and SMA (a company incorporated in the Marshall Islands which she owned and controlled ) entered into the so-termed \u2018Isle of Man Settlement\u2019 with Mr Cooper and Mr McNally (the \u201c IOM Settlement \u201d), including the signing of the IOM Confidential Deed on 24 March 2014 . 42. As Popplewell J (as he then was) found,6 the effect of the IOM Settlement was for Mr Cooper and Mr McNally to procure the transfer by the trustee of the Arena Settlement (AS Managers Ltd ) to Dr Smith, Dr Cochrane, SMA and/or their nominees, ownership and control of all of the businesses and property which they held under the terms of the 6 At [16] (page 25 ). See also the Directed Trial Judgment at [81] (page 91 ). A1.6/111 14 Arena Settlement (the \u201cArena Assets \u201d), together with other shareholdings in companies which were outside the Arena Settlement (the \u201cNon-Arena Assets \u201d). 43. In response to the IOM Settlement , Mr Ruhan alleged (and counterclaimed in the Original Proceedings for) the misappropriation of both the Arena and Non -Arena Assets , arguing that those assets were in reality his and tha t Mr Cooper and Mr McNally were always his nominees. Mr Ruhan advanced a proprietary claim to the assets and their traceable proceeds which were acquired by the Orb Parties from Messrs McNally and Cooper, both those from the Arena Settlement and the Non -Arena Assets, together with personal claims in constructive trust and conspiracy to defraud .7 44. Mr Justice Foxton found, in relation to the IOM Settlement, in his judgment dated 18 May 2021 in these proceedings (neutral citation [2021] EWHC 1272 (Comm)) (the \u201cDirected Trial \u201d and \u201c Directed Trial Judgment \u201d or \u201c DTJ \u201d) at [190] -[192] as follows : \u201c190. On its face, the IOM Settlement involved the transfer: i) by ASML of the Arena Companies; ii) by Messrs Cooper and McNally of the Cooper and McNally Companies; and iii) of cash held by the Arena Companies and Messrs Cooper and McNally; to Dr Cochrane and SMA. 191. On the transferee side, I am satisfied that Dr Cochrane and SMA were acting on behalf of the Orb Claimants, and that any assets which they received were received as nominees, on bare trust for the Orb Claimants... [...] 192. On the transferor side, I have already set out my reasons for concluding that any interest that Messrs Cooper and McNally had in the Transferred Assets was held as nominee for Mr Ruhan. \u201d (pages 121 -122). 45. In October 2014, Harbour, the Orb Claimants, Dr Cochrane, Messrs Cooper and McNally and Stewarts Law LLP (\u201c Stewarts \u201d) entered into a deed (the \u201c 2014 Harbour Deed \u201d) (pages 392 -395). The 2014 Harbour Deed provided that, for the purpose of Clause 9.1 of the Harbour IA (the \u2018Waterfall \u2019 referred to and defined below), the Settlement Consideration paid to or for the benefit of Dr Cochrane under the IOM MSA would be treated as \u201c proceeds received as a result of Success",

A1.6/112 15 as part of the Proceeds (page 393 ) (DTJ, \u00a787 ( page 93 )). 46. Of the assets placed within the control of the Orb Claimants by the IOM Settlement, Mr Justice Foxton found that a number were liquidated and their proceeds used to acquire various other assets (only some of which were at issue in the Directed Trial, as will be seen below: see \u00a788 of the DTJ) (page 93 ). 47. Further events (not sufficiently germane to the Enforceability Applications to be set out in detail herein) in the Original Proceedings are set out in [89] -[103] of the DTJ (pages 94-97). The Geneva Settlement 48. In or around April 2016, various settlement agreements were executed in Geneva (collectively, the \u201cGeneva Settlement \u201d) (DTJ, [105] (page 98 )). This settled the claims of all parties to the Original Proceedings (including Mr Ruhan\u2019s to recover assets transferred under the IOM Settlement ( DTJ, [232]) and led to the dismissal of the Original Proceedings by consent on 6 May 2016 ( DTJ, [105]) (pages 137 and 98 ). 49. Mr Justice Foxton noted various features of the constituent elements of the Geneva Settlement in the DTJ at [107] (page 98 -99), as follows : \u201cThe various agreements comprising the Geneva Settlement share the complexity which is characteristic of the dealings of those who were parties to them. However, in broad terms: i) A document which I will refer to as the \u201cConfidential Settlement Deed\u201d contained general releases by 11 parties of all claims relating to the 2012 Proceedings and associated litigation. ii) The seven principal individuals who were parties to the 2012 Proceedings entered into another document, \u201cthe Confidential Deed\u201d, which included covenants not to sue those parties and their affiliates (an expression defined in notably wide terms). iii) There were two agreements relating to Minardi: \u201cthe Minardi SpA\u201d and \u201cthe Minardi Deed of Release\u201d. The former transferred shares held in Minardi to Phoenix, a company said to be owned by Mr Stevens. The latter involved a release by SMA of a \u00a32,500,00 0 loan which it had made to Minardi. iv) A loan note issued by Dr Cochrane (\u201cthe Loan Note\u201d) under which Dr Cochrane agreed to pay \u00a373,750,000 to Phoenix by 31 December 2017 (under a structure which incentivised early A1.6/113 16 interim payments, to avoid an interest rate of 15%, the first instalment falling due on 31 May 2016 in the sum of \u00a33m). In support of that obligation Dr Cochrane provided a negative pledge over certain assets said to be worth \u00a380.2m. v) A document entitled the \u201cLiquidation Inter -Creditor Settlement Agreement\u201d (the \u201cLICSA\u201d) which was entered into between SMA, Phoenix, Minardi and Dr Cochrane, the terms of which are considered in detail at Section K below .\u201d 50.

(2) These SFO Proceedings 51. Following the IOM Settlement, a dispute arose between the SFO and other parties allegedly interested in the assets or reali sable property of Dr Smith that led to the se proceedings (the \u201cSFO Proceedings \u201d) in which the Enforceability Application s are now brought (Claim No. CL-2017 -000323 ). 52. My understanding of the background to the SFO Proceedings is (briefly) as follows: 52.1. They were initially commenced to enable the SFO to attempt to satisfy a confiscation order made against Dr Smith on 13 November 2007 (the \u201cConfiscation Order \u201d) by way of a claim to Dr Smith\u2019s alleged reali sable property within the meaning of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 : see \u00a78(i) , \u00a764, \u00a7\u00a7108 -116, and \u00a7\u00a7597 -599 of the DTJ (pages 71, 87, 99 -100 and 255 ); 52.2. The assets in relation to which the SFO was seeking to enforce the Confiscation Order were those assets allegedly constituting Dr Smith\u2019s reali sable property but alleged to have been held by the following persons as nominees for Dr Smith (with the effect of obscuring that those assets were his reali sable property )8: 8 This is a summary. See DTJ, \u00a7593 onwards for a fuller explanation (page 254 ). A1.6/114 17 52.2.1. SMA, in respect of the Transferred Companies; 52.2.2. Dr Cochrane, in respect of the Non -Arena Companies, the Jersey Properties , and any interest in the so-termed \u201cIdentified Underlying Assets\u201d (the \u201c IUAs \u201d) traceable to funds emanating from Dr Cochrane; 52.2.3. Litigation Capital Limited (\u201c LCL \u201d), in respect of the Non -Arena Companies to the extent transferred to them by the LCL Transfers (as defined in the DTJ) , the Jersey Properties and Flat 1 Hamilton House; 52.2.4. Conduit Asset Management Limited (\u201c Conduit \u201d), as the legal owner of the shares in LCL ; and 52.2.5. A Dr Imogen Smith in respect of Flat 1 Hamilton House . 52.3. At a hearing on 6 March 2017, Popplewell J directed any party claiming an interest in the relevant assets to file a position paper setting out which assets it asserted a claim to, and the basis of that claim : see \u00a7\u00a7102 -116 of the DTJ (pages 97-100); 52.4. 23 parties filed position papers and, following a further hearing, Popplewell J directed the SFO and the Enforcement Receivers ( appointed on the application of the SFO: see DTJ, \u00a78(i) (page 71 )), if so advised , to issue an application seeking a determination of the extent to which (what became) the Transferred and Non -Arena Companies and the Jersey Properties (each of which are defined in paragraph 53 below) (together, the \u201c Relevant Property \u201d) constituted the realisable property of Dr Smith for the purpose of enforcement of the Confiscation Order (DTJ, \u00a7117 ) (page 101 ); 52.5. On or around 24 or 25 April 2018, Popplewell J (amongst other things and per \u00a7121 of the DTJ) (page 102 ) joined various parties as respondents to the SFO Proceedings; and",

On or around 24 or 25 April 2018, Popplewell J (amongst other things and per \u00a7121 of the DTJ) (page 102 ) joined various parties as respondents to the SFO Proceedings; and directed the Directed Trial would take place to determine the A1.6/115 18 ownership of the Relevant Property ; and 52.6. The Court noted that, of the various parties asserting claims, Harbour, Stewarts, and Messrs Thomas and Taylor asserted their alleged entitlements arising from their involvement in the Original Proceedings on the side (at that time) of Dr Smith (DTJ, \u00a7156(iii)) (page 112 ), whilst the SFO asserted its entitlements in respect of any reali sable property of Dr Smith to the extent that it had not been found to be subject to the proprietary rights of other parties (DTJ, \u00a7593) (page 254). 53. In the event, the Directed Trial considered and determined the various claims to the Relevant Property , which fell into five categories: 53.1.

A1.6/116 19 (DTJ, \u00a71; Section O) (pages 69; 220 -223). 54. On 28 May 2021, Mr Justice Foxton handed down the DTJ on the ownership of the Relevant Property. The DTJ is wide -ranging and considers a vast number of issues which I do not attempt to s et these out in full here. Relevantly, however, the Court will note that Section H of the DTJ dealt with \u2018ISSUES ARISING IN RELATION TO THE HARBOUR IA\u2019 (pages 114 -121) and made findings about the assets that fell within the Harbour Trust, including whether they included assets transferred to Dr Cochrane or SMA under the IOM and/or Geneva Settlements ( DTJ, \u00a7\u00a7167 -181). 55.

I note that Mr Zoubir claims that this is \u201c not... fully accurate \u201d (in relation to a position apparently a dvanced by Dr Cochrane in the Jersey Proceedings) in that \u201cthe IUAs (which the Directed Trial did determine ownership of) were owned by various Non -Arena Companies \u201d (Zoubir 20, \u00a770). This is addressed in Mr Thomas\u2019 statement in relation to the Enforceability Applications. (3) The Consequentials Order and Proceed s The Consequentials Order 57. On 11 June 2021 Mr Justice Foxton made the Consequentials Order giving effect to his findings in the DTJ (pages 2 -21). Paragraph s 4 and 5 of th e Consequentials Order identified assets from the Relevant Property that fell within the Harbour Trust and how the interests of the Orb Claimants in them were to be apportioned inter se as follows: \u201cHarbour A1.6/117 20 4. The interests in the following assets are held by their legal owners on the terms of the Harbour Trust and are to be applied and apportioned between the beneficiaries, namely Harbour, Orb arl, and Messrs Thomas and Taylor, in accordance with those terms (save as set out below): a. The shares in the Arena Companies (as set out in Schedule 2 to this order); b. Such future distributions as may be paid or payable to the shareholders of the Arena Companies; c. The traceable proceeds of the IOM Settlement Cash, but in particular: i. An equitable interest of 100% in Flat 24 Hamilton House; ii. An equitable interest in 50% of the shares in Bodega; iii. An equitable interest of 100% in Flat 2 Hamilton House; iv. An equitable interest of 15% in Flat 22 Hamilton House; v. An equitable interest of 20.26% in the headlease / leasehold of Hamilton House and Flats 1, 10, and 14 Hamilton House (for Flats 10 and 14 Hamilton House, taking effect by way of a first ranking charge arising by way of subrogation to discharged security); vi. An equitable interest of 16.62% in Flats 11, 21 and 23 Hamilton House; vii. An equitable interest of 10% in Flat 17 Hamilton House d.

On or around 14 December 2022, Mr Justice Foxton made a further Order (the \u201c Trust Order \u201d) (pages 396 -400), this time within proceedings CL -2022 -000330 (the \u201cTicehurst Proceedings \u201d) which ordered ( inter alia ) that: 61.1. The shares in Glen Moar, Unicorn, Sulby, and two further companies known as Legion NA Investments Limited ( formerly Bridge Towers Holdings No I Ltd) and Land Consultants Limited , were declared to be held by SMA as bare trustee for Orb, Mr Thomas and Mr Taylor who in turn hold their respective interests jointly as trustees of the Harbour Trust (\u00a71) (page 398 ); 61.2. Messrs Thomas and Taylor and Orb were removed as trustees of the Harbour Trust with immediate effec t (\u00a75) (page 398 ); 61.3. New trustees (Emma Jordan and Tony Graham) (the so -termed \u201c New Trustees \u201d) were appointed as trustees of the trusts declared by paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order \u201cinsofar as those trusts affect the interests of Orb, Mr Thomas and Mr Taylor in the shares in the Relevant Companies [i.e. those listed A1.6/119 22 in paragraph 61.1 above] which SMA holds as nominee for them as trustees of the Harbour Trust ...\u201d (\u00a77) (page 398 ) together with ancillary orders dealing with practical issues arising with respect to their dealings with the relevant assets (\u00a7\u00a79-19) (pages 399 -400). 62. Likewise , on 14 December 2022, Mr Justice Foxton made an order in connection with multiple receivership applications (the \u201c Receivership Order \u201d) (pages 401 -411) in these SFO Proceedings . 63.

Schedule 1 to the Receivership Order sets out the assets to which it relates (and is not reproduced here) (pages 410 -411). I have cross -referenced Schedule 1 of the Receivership Or der with paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order (set out above) and note that : 64.1. All of the properties listed in paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order appear in Schedule 1 of the Receivership Order ; 64.2. Schedule 1 of the Receivership Order contains other properties not listed in paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order , namel y Flats 3, 18, 19, and 20 of Hamilton House, 81 Southampton Row, London, WC1B 4HA but these properties are all listed in Schedule 4 of the Consequentials Order (pages 19 - 21) as being (pursuant to \u00a7 20 of the same (page 10 )) the IUAs11 in which the companies under the Joint Liquidators\u2019 control (at that time) had equitable interests. 11 This is a reference in turn to paragraph 12 of the Order of Mr Justice Foxton dated 20 May 2020 (pages 423 - 499): see the tenth recital to the Consequentials Order (page 4 ). A1.6/120 23 65. On 10 February 2023, in both these SFO Proceedings and the Ticehurst Proceedings, Mr Justice Foxton ordered that SMA must transfer the shares in the Relevant Companies (i.e. those set out in paragraph 61.1 above) to the New Trustees (\u00a71) (pages 412 -422) (the \u201cShare Transfer Order \u201d). \u2018The Proceeds\u2019 66. I therefore understand that, as a result of the IOM and Geneva Settlements, very substantial assets were recovered and form the \u2018Proceeds\u2019 for the purposes of the Harbour IA. 67. Accordingly, and in summary, the Proceeds on which the Harbour IA could bite include (subject to the full terms of the Consequential s Order) : 67.1. All those assets listed in paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order, being (in summary ): 67.1.1. The shares in the Arena Companies set out in Schedule 2 of that Order . 67.1.2. The future distributions to be paid to shareholders of the Arena Companies . 67.1.3. The traceable proceeds of the IOM Settlement Cash (as defined) , but in particular the equitable interests in particular properties listed in \u00a74(c) . 67.1.4. The traceable proceeds of the c.\u00a323.9m paid to Candey LLP which in turn derived from a $43.5m Qatar Settlement Paym ent (as defined) , and in particular the equitable interests in the specific properties listed in \u00a74(d) . 67.2. Shares in the Non-Arena Companies which were not transferred under the IOM Settlement (DTJ, \u00a71(ii)) and are held by the Joint Receivers pursuant to the A1.6/121 24 Receivership Order (as above) , and in turn the assets of the Non -Arena Companies. 68. It is my understanding that, to date, no assets or funds falling within the Harbour Trust have been released to or realised by any of the Orb Claimants or Harbour. 69. Moreover, I note that there has been and remains a significant dispute about the value of the Proceeds. For example, Harbour asserted in a letter (via its solicitors, Harcus Parker) dated 2 July 2021 that the total estimated realisable value of the assets held within the Harbour Trust pursuant to the Harbour IA at that",

Moreover, I note that there has been and remains a significant dispute about the value of the Proceeds. For example, Harbour asserted in a letter (via its solicitors, Harcus Parker) dated 2 July 2021 that the total estimated realisable value of the assets held within the Harbour Trust pursuant to the Harbour IA at that time was \u00a323,865,935.70. This is disput ed by Mr Thomas . However, it is not necessary for the Court to determine those valuation issues as part of the Enforceability Application s. (4) The Jersey Proceedings 70. Harbour is also presently engaged in proceedings (Court reference 2023/35) before the Royal Court of Jersey against Dr Cochrane (respectively, the \u201c Jersey Proceedings \u201d and the \u201cJersey Court \u201d). Dr Cochrane is, as I understand, the sole legal owner of the shares in Orb . Bankruptcy orders 71. As I understand it (although I do not act for any party to the Jersey Proceedings) the position is as follows. 72. On 10 November 2016, Harbour applied for the property of Orb and Dr Cochrane to be declared en d\u00e9sastre and o n 24 November 2016, Harbour obtained bankruptcy (en d\u00e9sastre ) orders against Orb and Dr Cochrane from the Jersey Court, the effect of which was to vest the property of Orb and Dr Cochrane in the Viscount of Jersey as administrator of their estates (subject to an exception which is not material for present purposes) . 73. It appears from \u00a712 of Mr Adam Zoubir\u2019s Affidavit in the Jersey Proceedings dated 18 June 2024 (the \u201cZoubir Jersey Affidavit \u201d) that the basis for this decision was the Jersey A1.6/122 25 Court\u2019s finding that Harbour was \u201c indisputably owed the liquidated sum of \u00a35,189,010.48p by Orb and that there was no reasonably arguable defence to that claim \u201d, i.e. it was on the basis of Harbour\u2019s assumed entitlements under the Harbour IA . Mr Zoubir confirms Harbour\u2019s relevant assumed entitlement as follows at \u00a713 : \u201cThe principal figure is based on a total of Harbour\u2019s investment of nearly \u00a35.2 million, plus a calculation of the returns owed under the Funding Agreement, which are triggered by the Orb Claimants\u2019 success in the funded proceedings .\u201d (pages 377 -378). The Recall and Stay Applications 74. After the PACCAR decision was handed down, Dr Cochrane sought to have her \u2018d\u00e9sastre\u2019 set aside or annulled , together with that of Orb (i.e. the liquidation order made against it) (the \u201c Cochrane Recall Application \u201d) (pages 450 -464). 75. At least part of t he basis of th is application is, as I understand it, Dr Cochrane\u2019s assertion that the Harbour IA is unenforceable as a result of the clarification of the law on DBAs in the PACCAR decision ; and therefore, Orb and Dr Cochrane are not (and never have been) indebted to Harbour . 76. Upon the making of the Cochrane Recall Application, I understand that Harbour applied to stay that application (the \u201c Harbour Stay Application \u201d). In the Zoubir Jer sey Affidavit (pages 375 -391), Mr Zoubir told the Jersey Court , on behalf of Harbour, that: 76.1. Harbour sought a stay of the Cochrane Set Aside Application on the basis that (per \u00a739.1): \u201cHarbour now intends to seek a determination from the English Court as to the status of the Directed Trial Judgment including as to the impact if any of the decision in PACCAR as well as ancillary matters.

If the Jersey court were to deal with these issues, which relate to an extraordinarily complex English law dispute with a lengthy history, various English Court judgments and the Funding Agreement (which is governed by English law), it would need to hear expert evidence of English law. I would respectfully suggest that it would be preferable for any such English law issues to be determined by the English court if possible , particularly one that is very familiar with the entire background to the matter .\u201d (my emphasis) (pages 387 ); 76.2. Harbour further considered that the English Court \u201c is already seized of this matter \u201d and is familiar with the same (\u00a739.4) (pages 388 ); and A1.6/123 26 76.3. \u201cHarbour intends to seek declarations from the English Court in respect of the status of the Directed Trial Judgment and related and ancillary matters \u201d (\u00a739.5) (pages 388 -389). 77. That was told to the Jersey Court in June 2024. In response, Harbour was ordered by the Jersey Court to \u201c file further evidence about the proceedings it intends to bring, including a copy of the intended proceedings and any opinion on the merits, the latter for the court only, by 5pm on 2 August 2024 \u201d (pages 465 -466). In a follow -up affidavit sworn on 2 August 2024 (pages 467-474), Mr Zoubir provided to the Jersey Court , on behalf of Harbour , a draft Application Notice (pages 475 -482) together with a draft witness statement of Mr Zoubir (the \u201c Draft Zoubir Statement \u201d) (pages 483 -540) and an indication that Mr Zoubir \u201c envisage[d] that Harbour will issue its application [in the English Court] in the early Autumn \u201d (\u00a723(3)). 78. As set out above, Harbour finally issued its application at the end of October 2024 , shortly before the Harbour Stay Application was due to be heard. 79. I am instructed that the Harbour Stay Application has now been granted . 80. Save as set out above , I do not explain the Jersey Proceedings in greater detail where this is already addressed at some length in Appendix 2 to Zoubir 20 and is not relevant to the substance of the Enforceability Application s (at least insofar as they concern Mr Thomas) . For the avoidance of doubt, Mr Thomas should not thereby be taken to accept the accuracy or relevance of any matters stated in Appendix 2 of Zoubir 20 and will respond further if that becomes necessary. D. THE HARBOUR IA \u2013 KEY TERMS 81. As I have explained above the Orb Claimants and Harbour entered into the Harbour IA on or around 10 July 2013 . A copy of the Harbour IA is at pages 280 -374.

Mr Thomas and Harbour engaged in extensive pre -action correspondence about the various issues arising from the PACCAR decision and their implications for the Harbour A1.6/129 32 IA. In particular, I draw to the Court\u2019s attention the following substantive correspondence which sets out the parties\u2019 respective positions and the dispute which now remains : 93.1. MH\u2019s detailed Letter Before Action (the \u201cLBA \u201d) dated 11 July 2024 (pages 781-800); 93.2. Harcus Parker \u2019s letter of 26 July 2024 to MH stating that it would be filing with the Jersey Court on 2 August 2024 draft evidence in support of its proposed application to this Court ; that it was prepared to share that evidence simultaneously with MH; and that it would set out Harbour\u2019s position in detail on the points raised in the LBA (pages 801 -803); 93.3. That draft evidence ( in the form of the Draft Zoubir Statement ), which was sent to MH on 2 August 2024 (pages 482 -540); and 93.4. Subsequent correspondence between Harcus Parker and MH dated 7 August 2024 (pages 804 -808); 23 August 2024 (pages 809 -816); 9 September 2024 (pages 817 -821); and 25 September 2024 (pages 822 -828). (the \u201c Pre-Action Correspondence \u201d). 94. As I have explained above, Harbour told the Jersey Court that it intended to bring an application for declarations concerning the enforceability or otherwise of the Harbour IA by the early autumn (of 2024) (page 471 ), and told Mr Thomas that it first wished to engage in the Pre -Action Correspondence to narrow",

As I have explained above, Harbour told the Jersey Court that it intended to bring an application for declarations concerning the enforceability or otherwise of the Harbour IA by the early autumn (of 2024) (page 471 ), and told Mr Thomas that it first wished to engage in the Pre -Action Correspondence to narrow the issues as far as reasonably possible . This Pre -Action Correspondence failed to resolve the dispute. 95. When it became clear that the Pre -Action Correspondence had achieved all that it realistically could , MH\u2019s letter dated 25 September 2024 (pages 822 -828) concluded as follows: \u201cTo conclude: (i) It is obvious from your letter that the pre -action period is now at an end. (ii) We now invite your client to confirm by return that it will issue its promised application A1.6/130 33 within 14 days of today. [i.e. by 9 October 2024 ] (iii) If your client is not prepared to issue its application in this time, please inform us forthwith. (iv) Please also respond clearly, directly and promptly to the three questions set out in paragraph 13 of our letter of 30 July 2024 and repeated in paragraphs 17 -18 above regarding the Debarring Directions Order. \u201d (page s 827-828). 96. Harcus Parker wrote to MH on 9 October 2024 agree ing that the Pre -Action Correspondence had reached its end (\u00a72) and confirming that it anticipated filing its application \u201cbefore the end of the week commencing 21 October 2024, if not sooner \u201d (\u00a78) (page 830 ). As it was, the Harbour A pplication was only filed on 31 October 2024. 97. Mr Thomas now responds to th e Harbour A pplication and makes the Thomas Cross - Application . The Court is therefore asked to resolve the remaining issues in dispute along (it would appear) with some additional arguments raised by Harbour for the first time in Zoubir 20 .12 (2) The remaining issues 98. Zoubir 20 accepts , at least , that part of the Harbour IA is a DBA and that the DBA is not compliant with the relevant legislation (\u00a781). 99. Following the Pre -Action Correspondence , and having regard to Zoubir 20, the remaining dispute appears to concern the following issues (the \u201c Issues \u201d): 99.1. The full extent of the non -compliance of the key parts of the Harbour IA identified in the LBA (the \u201c Remaining DBA Issues \u201d). In sum, it is Mr Thomas\u2019 case that the Harbour IA is partly unenforceable by Harbour because that or those parts is/are a DBA for the purposes of s.58AA of the CLSA 1990 and fail(s) to comply with the provisions of the CLSA 1990 and/or the DBA Regs 2013. Mr Thomas contends that: (i) key parts of the Harbour IA which fall to be considered a DBA is/are non-compliant with the relevant legislation in a number of material respects explained below ; and (ii) accordingly, those parts are 12 A comparison between the Draft Zoubir Statement and Zoubir 20 demonstrates that a series of new points are now being advanced by Harbour , including an aspect of its argument on severance and its wholly new case on estoppel by deed.

This is addressed in Section H below. 100.

For completeness, I note that some potential legal issues have been mentioned by Harbour only by name and are not explained further (see, for example, Zoubir 20 at \u00a7114). I address these below to the extent possible in light of Harbour\u2019s failure to articulate them. Mr Thomas will address these them further once Harbour has properly explained its case in these aspects. A1.6/132 35 F. THE REMAINING DBA ISSUES (1) The DBA and non-compliance 102. As mentioned above, i n the Pre -Action C orrespondence (and now in Zoubir 20) Harbour has accepted that at least parts of the Harbour IA are required to, but do not, comply with at least some requirements of the DBA Regs 2013 . 103. In summary, Mr Thomas\u2019 position is as follows : 103.1. Pursuant to the Harbour IA, Harbour provided financial services and/or assistance to ( inter alia ) Mr Thomas in relation to the making of a claim (the Original Proceedings referred to above ). 103.2. Per the key terms of the Harbour IA set out above, the Harbour IA provides that, in the event of Success in the Proceedings (as defined) , a series of payment s are to be made to Harbour in accordance with Clause 9.1(a) -(e), including (per Clause 9.1(e) ) a payment or payments calculated by reference to the amount of the financial benefit obtained ( set out in Schedule 2 ). 103.3. In the circumstances, Mr Thomas \u2019 case is that significant portions of the Harbour IA is/are a DBA . Specifically : 103.3.1. Clause s 9.1(a) -(e) (or each of them) , together with Schedule 2 , constitute (s) the (or a) DBA . 103.3.2. Alternatively, Clause 9 .1(e), together with Schedule 2 , constitute (s) the (or a) DBA . 103.3.3. In the further alternative , Schedule 2 alone constitutes the (or a) DBA . 103.3.4. On all of the above cases, Clauses 10.2, 12.1 , and /or 14.4 are also part of the (or a) DBA ,",

Alternatively, Clause 9 .1(e), together with Schedule 2 , constitute (s) the (or a) DBA . 103.3.3. In the further alternative , Schedule 2 alone constitutes the (or a) DBA . 103.3.4. On all of the above cases, Clauses 10.2, 12.1 , and /or 14.4 are also part of the (or a) DBA , or are themselves DBA elements within the Harbour IA . A1.6/133 36 103.4. The above portions of the Harbour IA fail to comply with various provisions of s.58AA(4) CLSA 1990 and the DBA Regs 2013 relating to DBAs . 103.5. Consequently, the key parts of the Harbour IA constituting the (or a) DBA are unenforceable by Harbour against Mr Thomas (and the other Orb Claimants ). 104. Relevantly, I note the following admissions made by Harbour in Zoubir 20 (and in the Pre-Action Correspondence) about the effect of the CLSA 1990 and DBA Regs 2013 and their impact on the Harbour IA : 104.1. First, Harbour concedes that the Harbour IA contains two elements of a DBA identified in s.58AA(3) of the CLSA 1990 in that: (i) it involves the provision of \u201cclaims management services \u201d; and (ii) that service is provided in return for a payment that is: (a) contingent on the success of the Causes of Action; and ( b) calculated as a proportion of the financial benefit obtained by the Orb Claimants from that success13 (Zoubir 20 , \u00a7\u00a775, 76 and 7 9-80); 104.2. Second , Harbour concedes that the Harbour IA does not comply with the requirement , imposed by Regulation 3(c) of the DBA Regs 201 3, that the Harbour IA specify the reason for setting the amount of its return at the levels mentioned in Schedule 2 (Zoubir 20 , \u00a781) (page 510 ). Specifically (Breach 1) , the DBA within the Harbour IA fails to set out : (i) the reason for any of the percentage entitlements at the levels provided for in Schedule 2 (and therefore also by Clause 9.1(e) , which incorporates Schedule 2 ); (ii) the reason for the ir escalations (encompassing both the reason for there being escalations at all and the particular escalations included ); or (iii) the reason for there being a further, general uplift to be applied in specified circumstances (e.g. the \u2018Any Time Period\u2019 allowances) . 105. I also note that Zoubir 20 at \u00a779 seeks to give precisely the kind of reasons which needed 13 This last point was implicitly conceded by the comment in \u00a7\u00a770-71 of the Draft Zoubir Statement (page 505 - 506). My firm noted Harbour\u2019s apparent concession on the proportion point in my firm\u2019s letter of 23 August 2024 (\u00b615(iii)) (page 813 ). Harcus Parker did not address this in Harbour\u2019s response dated 9 September 2024 (pages 817-821). I believe its silence is to be regard ed as a tacit acknowledgment that my interpretation of this part of the Draft Zoubir Statement was correct. Those passages of the Draft Zoubir Statement are substantially retained in Zoubir 20 (served following the above -referenced inter partes correspondence ): see Zoubir 20, \u00a7\u00a7 79-80, with some deleted references to Dr Cochrane . A1.6/134 37 to be (but were not) included within the DBA element of the Harbour IA to comply with Regulation 3(c) . 106.

These are important admissions , as noted in MH\u2019s letter dated 23 August 2024 (pages 809-816). (2) Other material non-compliance 107. Whilst, as above, Harbour concedes non -compliance in the respect referred to above , Mr Thomas contends that the DBA element(s) of the Harbour IA is /are, in fact , also non- compliant with the CLSA 1990 and/or the DBA Regs 2013 in several other important respects explained below . 108. There are, I believe, at least four further breaches of the DBA Regs 2013 in relation to Regulation 4(3) : 108.1. Breach 2. Clause s 9.1(a) -(e) and Schedule 2 of the Harbour IA provide for a potential payment to Harbour of an amount (substantially) above 50% of the sums ultimately recovered by the Orb Claimants . This is prohibited under Regulation 4(3). Illustrative examples of this non -compliance were set out by Mr Thomas in his LBA (\u00a7\u00a742-51) (pages 796 -797). 108.2. By way of illustration : 108.2.1. Harbour asserted in a letter dated 2 July 2021 (pages 773 -780) that the total estimated realisable value of the assets held within the Harbour Trust pursuant to the Harbour IA at that time was \u00a323,865,935.70; 108.2.2. Harbour went on in that letter t o state that, on the assumption its valuation was correct (which, as I state above, is disputed by Mr Thomas ), the minimum to which Harbour would be entitled under the Harbour IA was \u00a325,945,052.40 comprising payment of the HF2 Investment (as defined) and the return calculated under Schedule 2 A1.6/135 38 to the same ; and 108.2.3. On this basis, Harbour envisaged that it would take 100% of the Proceeds (as defined ) and the funded parties would receive nothing under the Harbour IA , under the terms of Clauses 9.1(b) and 9.1(e) and Schedule 2 . 108.3. Breach 3. Clause 10.2 of the Harbour IA provides in essence an alternative waterfall by which , if the Orb Claimants, including Mr Thomas, refuse to accept an offer they are recommended to accept, and then recover less than that offer, the payment due to Harbour would (pursuant to Clause 10.2(e) ) be based on the amount of the rejected offer rather than the Proceeds (as defined) in fact recovered. Hence the Harbour IA again asserts a right for Harbour (potentially ) to be paid an amount above 50% of the sums ultimately recovered by the Orb Claimants , and is a second breach of Regulation 4(3). 108.4. Breach 4. Clause 12.1 of the Harbour IA again provides , in certain circumstances, for a payment to Harbour in excess of 50% of recoveries by artificially inflating or broadening the scope of the Proceeds /recoveries against which Harbour\u2019s purported entitlements are assessed (i.e. beyond actual recoveries to include \u2018any sum from any third party in respect of any matter relating to the Causes of Action, including sums received as rebates on VAT paid by the Claimants in respect o f the Claimants \u2019 Legal Costs ). 108.5. Breach 5. Clause 14.4 (ii) of the Harbour IA provides for a payment to Harbour from the Proceeds of an amount corresponding to the HF 2 Investment and interest thereon of 10% per annum, which was always capable of amounting to more than 50% of the Proceeds. This means that (combined) there was always the possibility that the",

Clause 14.4 (ii) of the Harbour IA provides for a payment to Harbour from the Proceeds of an amount corresponding to the HF 2 Investment and interest thereon of 10% per annum, which was always capable of amounting to more than 50% of the Proceeds. This means that (combined) there was always the possibility that the Orb Claimants would be required by its terms to pay Harbour an amount above 50% of the sums ultimately recovered by the Orb Claimants . 109. Finally (Breach 6), I believe that the relevant part(s) of the Harbour IA breach (es) A1.6/136 39 Regulation 4(1) of the DBA Rega 2013 in that it fails to \u2018net off\u2019 recovered costs from the sums claimable in or by reference to Schedule 2 . 110. As was noted in Mr Thomas\u2019 LBA (pages 781 -800): 110.1. Whilst the (purported) payment liabilities of the Orb Claimants are contained in the Waterfall, and each element is deducted before moving to the next item, Clause 9.1(e) simply provides for payment to the Trust Beneficiaries (including Harbour ) out of amounts calculated by reference to the formula set out in Schedule 2 . 110.2. Schedule 2 provides for percentage and multiplier calculations in respect of the \u201cProceeds \u201d where, a s explained in paragraph 82.3 above, \u2018Proceeds\u2019 is a defined term to include gross sums which are not net of , for example, inter partes costs recoveries . 110.3. Clause 9.1(e) and/or Schedule 2 provide for the percentage payments to be made to Harbour without \u2018netting off\u2019 the costs from those payments . 111. This, I believe, is a clear breach of Regulation 4(1). 112. Taking those matters in the round, Mr Thomas contends that there is material (and substantial) non-compliance by the DBA element (s) of the Harbour IA with the DBA Regs 2013 . (3) Enforceability 113. The effect of the DBA elements of t he Harbour IA\u2019s non -compliance with the DBA Regs 2013 is principally a matter for legal submissions in due course and is/are not explained in detail here. 114. By way of summary, however, Mr Thomas \u2019 position is that: 114.1. The DBA elements of the Harbour IA (summarised in paragraph 103.3 above) are unenforceable by Harbour as against Mr Thomas and the other funded parties under the Harbour IA under s.58AA(2) of the CLSA, which provides A1.6/137 40 that \u201c [a DBA] which does not satisfy [the requirements of the DBA Regs 2013] is unenforceable \u201d. 114.2. Harbour is thus not entitled to any payment under Clauses 9.1 (a)-(e), on Mr Thomas\u2019 primary case , or alternatively is not entitled to any payment calculated by reference to Clause 9.1(e) and/or Schedule 2 . G. HARBOUR\u2019S SEVERANCE ARGUMENT (1) The proposed form of severance 115. Harbour asserted in the Pre -Action C orrespondence that it intends to rely on Clause 25.1 of the Harbour IA in an attempt to save at least some of the key provisions impugned by Mr Thomas, in circumstances where (at least) aspects of it are plainly non -compliant with the CLSA 1990 and/or DBA Regs 2013 , as set out above (see paragraphs 101 -115 of the draft 20th Zoubir witness statement provided pre -action to MH on 2 August 2024 ( pages 515-520)) 116. Clause 25.1 states: \u201cIf any term or provision in this Agreement shall in whole or in part be held to any extent to be illegal or unenforceable under any enactment or rule of law, that term",

Clause 25.1 states: \u201cIf any term or provision in this Agreement shall in whole or in part be held to any extent to be illegal or unenforceable under any enactment or rule of law, that term or provision or part shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement and the enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected \u201d (page 304 ). 117. For the first time, Zoubir 20 identifies a further facet to Harbour\u2019s severance argument, which is that (Harbour says) there is a difference in the approach to be taken where the Court is concerned with a contractual severance clause rather than severance at common law (Zoubir 20, \u00a7120 ). Specifically, Harbour contends that this circumvents the elements of the common law test which cause its proposed form of severance so much difficulty: \u201cThis is a straightforward exercise in contractual interpretation which does not require reference to the general common law principles concerning severance, or to satisfy the general common law test. In particular, in the contractual interpretation context the court is not limited to deletions, it does not matter whether there is surplus language left over and there is no need to consider whether the overall balance of the contract remains the same .\u201d (Zoubir 20, \u00a7120) (emphasis added). 118. These are legal submission s (the bas es for which are not articulated in Zoubir 20) which A1.6/138 41 Mr Thomas will address in due course. For now, Harbour appears to stand by the so - called \u2018Modified Schedule 2\u2019 in Zoubir 20 (\u201cModified Schedule 2 \u201d) and contends that the words struck through in Modified Schedule 2 could be severed from Schedule 2 so as to leave an otherwise compliant and enforceable agreement. 119. Harbour\u2019s proposed form of severance (which, for the avoidance of doubt, Mr Thomas disputes) is as follows , with Harbour\u2019s proposed deletions from Schedule 2 struck through with red lines : 120. I note that Harbour proposes no severance to Clause s 9, 12.1, and/or 14.4 and does not address the breaches arising in relation to those Clauses referred to above . A1.6/139 42 (2) Defects in Harbour\u2019s proposed form of severance regarding Schedule 2 121. I make the following observations about Harbour\u2019s proposed form of severance in relation to Schedule 2 to the Harbour IA , bearing in mind that Mr Thomas\u2019 full position will be articulated in legal submissions in due course . 122. First, even assuming the Modified Schedule 2 meets the test for severance (which, as below, Mr Thomas does not accept) , the text which is proposed to be severed is not the only wording in the relevant portions of the Harbour IA which pr ovides for a \u201cpercentage based recovery \u201d (to use , without admission, the description in Zoubir 20 ). 123. Second , Mr Thomas will contend in any event that the words proposed to be severed cannot, in fact, be severed under Clause 25.1 or at common law because (without limitation and without rehearsing the detailed legal submissions which will be made in due course) : 123.1. There is no justifiable basis for deletin g \u201c(but in any case, \u201d from Schedule 2 because, as explained in the Pre -Action Correspondence (see paragraph 18 of MH\u2019s letter dated 23 August 2024 (pages 813 -814), it is",

The text and words quoted above (\u201c(but in any case, \u201d) are neither illegal nor unenforceable , and Harbour does not seem to contend otherwise . Mr Thomas\u2019 position is that Harbour is not entitled to sever them merely because it finds them inconvenient . 123.2. Moreover , Zoubir 20 is, I believe, wrong to say ( at \u00a7123 ) that, \u201c the Modified Schedule 2 provisions are workable, and do not require any re -writing or amendment in order to be understood \u201d. All that the Modified Schedule 2 would provide (if so modified) is that, after repayment of the HF2 Investment, Harbour is entitled to \u201c an amount no less than [x] times the HF2 Investment \u201d (emphasis added) . That is not a statement of the sum to which Harbour would be entitled; it is just a statement of one criterion applicable to the calculation of that sum without there being any other basis in the agreement for calculating the sum. For the Modified Schedule 2 to provide the necessary certainty as to Harbour\u2019s payment entitlement it would need to add words to enable that sum to be A1.6/140 43 calculated (which Mr Thomas contends is not permissible) . 123.3. Further , Modified Schedule 2 would effect a major change in the nature of the Harbour IA (which Mr Thomas also contends is not permissible) , for example (and without limitation) by significantly alter ing the basis on which Harbour\u2019s payment entitlements would be calculated (e.g. the deletion of percentage entitlements and retention (only) of multiplie r entitlements ) and/or the amount likely to be paid to Harbour in various circumstances (e.g. the deletion of the \u2018Any Time Period\u2019 entitlements). 124. These points were put to Harbour in the Pre -Action Correspondence , including by reference to the applicable legal principles (not rehearsed herein) . I draw the Court\u2019s attention in particular to paragraphs 18 -22 of MH\u2019s letter dated 23 August 2024 (pages 813-814) which were substantially unaddressed by Harbour in its responsive letter dated 9 September 2024 (pages 817 -821). Indeed, Harbour stated at paragraphs 13 -14 of that letter merely that: \u201c13. As to paragraphs 18 and 19 of Your Letter, Harbour maintains its position as to the application of the principles of severability and/or characterisation as an agreement other than a DBA. 14. With regard to paragraphs 20 to 23 of Your Letter, Mr Zoubir\u2019s draft statement addresses these matters in some detail. Harbour maintains the position set out therein, and nothing in Your Letter alters its views in this regard .\u201d (page 820 ). 125. Regrettably, Harbour\u2019s failure to engag e with the issues in its case on severance is repeated in Zoubir 20 , such that Mr Thomas still does not know Harbour\u2019s response to those points (if indeed it has one): \u201cI note also that in pre -action correspondence, having received the draft of this Application, Marriot Harrison has indicated that Mr Thomas disagrees with Harbour application of the principles of severability in respect of the proposed Modified Schedule 2.

These objections would only appear to have application to the common law approach not the exercise in contractual interpretation referred to above. Harbour reserves its position in this regard, including as to the further modification of Schedule 2 and any arguments about how the surviving wording may be interpreted, pending receipt of Mr Thomas\u2019s responsive evidence .\u201d (Zoubir 20, \u00a7 121). 126. I respectfully submit that Harbour should articulate its case on severance now, including its answer to Mr Thomas\u2019 responsive arguments , of which it has been aware for some A1.6/141 44 time, so that Mr Thomas has a fair opportunity to consider and respond to them . H. HARBOUR\u2019S ALTERNATIVE ABUSE OF PROCESS AND LIMITATION ARGUMENT S 127. As an alternative way of escaping the consequences of the CLSA 1990 and the DBA Regs 2013 , Harbour alternatively contends that Mr Thomas is time -barred from ventilating those arguments and/or that it would be abusive for him to do so (in both respects, even, it seems, in response (and opposition ) to the Harbour A pplication to which Harbour recognises Mr Thomas should be made a Respondent because his interests are very obviously affected by it ). (1) Limitation 128. First, Harbour contends that Mr Thomas\u2019 arguments above are time -barred. This is a matter for legal submissions in due course although I refer the Court to the parties\u2019 Pre- Action C orrespondence on this point: specifically, my firm\u2019s letter of 23 August 2024 (paras. 9 -13) (pages 811 -812) and Harbour\u2019s response dated 9 September 2024 (para. 11) (page 820 ). 129. Harbour\u2019s limitation argument is difficult to follow but appears to be as follows : 129.1. Paragraph 11 of Harcus Parker\u2019s letter of 9 September 2024 (page 820 ) identified section 5 of the 1980 Act as the basis of Harbour \u2019s limitation argument , stating as follows: \u201cOn the face of things, a claim for repayment of money following a finding that the Harbour IA is unenforceable would fall within section 5 of the LA 1980, and the PACCAR Decision declares what the statutory framework has always meant ...\u201d 129.2. Quite apart from the generality , and lack of explanation, of this position (and without prejudice to the more detailed submissions Mr Thomas will make in due course ), I note that the relief sought by Mr Thomas in the Thomas Cross - Application involves no claim for repayment of monies by Harbour (or any other entity). My firm pointed this out in Mr Thomas\u2019 response (pages 822 -828). A1.6/142 45 129.3. For the avoidance of doubt, Mr Thomas has been upfront about the relief he intends to seek : see MH\u2019s letter of 25 September 2024 (\u00a713) (pages 823 -824). 130. In any event, Harbour\u2019s time-bar argument seems to me to be inconsistent with its own application for (among other things) mirror -image declaratory relief in relation to the validity of the Harbour IA, i.e. a declaration that it is enforceable by Harbour . This is set out in Harbour\u2019s draft order in support the Harbour Application . Again, MH made this point in the Pre -Action Correspondence14 (before the",

In any event, Harbour\u2019s time-bar argument seems to me to be inconsistent with its own application for (among other things) mirror -image declaratory relief in relation to the validity of the Harbour IA, i.e. a declaration that it is enforceable by Harbour . This is set out in Harbour\u2019s draft order in support the Harbour Application . Again, MH made this point in the Pre -Action Correspondence14 (before the Harbour Application was issued) without adequate reply . Zoubir 20 does not address this poi nt (either) \u2013 i.e. the basis on which Harbour contends that a claim for declaratory relief by Mr Thomas as summarised above can be said to be time -barred . Harbour will have an opportunity to set out its position on this clearly in its responsive evidence , and should do so that Mr Thomas can understand the argument he is expected to meet in good time before the hearing of the Enforceability Applications . If it fails to do so, I believe that Harbour should be debarred /prevented from pursuing a time -bar argument. 131. For completeness, I note that Zoubir 20 also raise s \u201claches \u201d as a possible basis for denying Mr Thomas the relief he seeks (Zoubir 20, \u00a7 141). This is the first time laches has been raised. Mr Zoubir does not explain the basis for this alternative argument. As a result, and again, Mr Thomas does not know the case he has to meet in this regard and Harbour is invited to set outs its position clearly in its responsive evidence , failing which I believe it should be debarred /prevented from pursuing this point. (2) Abuse of process 132. Harbour alternatively argues that Mr Thomas could and should have litigated an argument that the DBA element (s) of the Harbour IA was /were unenforceable by Harbour \u201c at any time after it was agreed \u201d (Zoubir 20 , \u00a798) and any attempt to make these arguments now would be \u201c abusive \u201d. Mr Zoubir goes on: \u201c... the Smith Parties [defined by Mr Zoubir to include Mr Thomas] have had ample opportunities to argue that the Harbour IA was subject to the DBA regulations and failed to do so. I would respectfully suggest that these matters are res judicata, or give rise to cause of action or issue estoppel, or that it would be abusive, for reasons that will be expanded upon in submissions, for 14 MH letter dated 23 August 2024, \u00a713 (page 812 ). A1.6/143 46 them to be allowed to do so now .\u201d (Zoubir 20, \u00a7114). 133. No proper attempt is made in Zoubir 20 to address the different legal and factual elements of these (distinct) legal concepts or to explain in what sense phrases like \u2018res judicata\u2019 are used. That, regrettably, is the continuation of Harbour\u2019s vague and evasive approach to these potential arguments in the Pre -Action Correspondence. As I say above, Mr Thomas\u2019 position is that Harbour should explain those arguments in its responsive evidence or be prevented from advancing them at the hearing of the Enforceabilit y Applications. 134. So far as it has been explained , Harbour\u2019s argument, in essence, is (as I understand) that Mr Thomas could and should have been aware of the arguments he advances in this application as long ago as 2014 and, therefore, raised them at the Directed Trial , because Harbour has been able to identify a single academic article from Professor Rachel Mulheron on the subject dating from November 2014 titled, \u2018 England's unique approach to the",

At this stage, I make the following observations in response : 135.1. Mr Thomas is a lay person . The idea that he ought to have been aware of complex potential arguments about the potential invalidity of the (or part of the) Harbour IA prior to the decision of the Supreme Court in PACCAR , when that did not even reflect the understanding of the litigation funding industry and specialist litigators, is, I believe, unreasonable . 135.2. Indeed, it seems to me that the logical result of Harbour\u2019s argument \u2013 that the issue was so well -known that a lay person such as Mr Thomas would or should have been aware of it \u2013 is that Harbour itself must or should also have been aware that the Harbour IA might well have been invalid; yet notwithstanding that, it allowed the Court to give judgments, make orders , and grant Harbour substantial monetary relief which it would or should have been aware it may not have been entitled to , without drawing the Court\u2019s attention to this issue. I A1.6/144 47 respectfully suggest this underlines the lack of realism in Harbour\u2019s argument that Mr Thomas is acting abusively or unconscionably in seeking a declaration that a part or parts of the Harbour IA is /are invalid, given the clarification of the law provided in the PACCAR decision . 135.3. To bolster its argument , Harbour relies on the fact that Mr Thomas was ( at times over the last decade or so ) represented by lawyers . However, that argument ignores the reality that none of those legal teams were a ware , either, of the potential argument which was eventually vindicated in PACCAR : 135.3.1. As noted above , there was a widespread understanding, common both to the litigation funding industry (including Harbour) and specialist litigators and academics in this area, that litigation funding agreements such as the Harbour IA were not subject to the CLSA 1990 and/or the DBA Regs 2013 135.3.2. The Mulheron Article which identified a potential counter -argument (on which Harbour\u2019s abuse argument appears to rest) reached the strident conclusion that the counter -argument \u201cwould be bound to fail\u201d. 135.3.3. So, Harbour\u2019s position appears to be that Mr Thomas or one of his legal teams should have discovered the Mulheron Article on the point (being the only article which Harbour relies on) and commenced a declaration claim (presumably at the Directed Trial) based on an argument in the article its (specialist) author had concluded was \u201cbound to fail \u201d, such as to make it unconscionable to pursue that argument now (even in response and opposition to an application by Harbour for essentially mirror -image relief ). I believe this to be an unreal argument . 136. Zoubir 20 contains a series of vague assertions that Mr Thomas had \u201c extremely extensive \u201d, \u201c numerous \u201d, \u201cmultiple \u201d and \u201cample",

However, I note that his statement fails to engage (even at a high level ) with the issues that were within the scope of the Directed Trial . Mr Zoubir does not identify the issues actually in dispute in the Directed Trial ; nor does he explain why, in that context, it would have been reasonable for and incumbent on Mr Thomas to raise the issue of the enforceability of part (s) of the Harbour IA by Harbour at that time or within the scope of the Directed Trial . 137. Nor has Harbour ever properly explain ed why it considers Mr Thomas to be abusive in bringing points before the Court where (i) Harbour has already informed the Jersey Court that, in its view, those points should be positively determined by the English Court, and (ii) Harbour has brought its own application and seek s its own relief in relation to the same issues . 138. Mr Thomas await s a proper explanation of Harbour\u2019s case . In the meantime, I note tha t the enforceability of the relevant part(s) of the Harbour IA by Harbour (including as against the other beneficiaries of the Harbour Trust ) was not an issue that was in dispute at the Directed Trial (not least where the Directed Trial preceded the PACCAR decision of the Supreme Court ). Nor was it relevant to the issues that were in dispute at the trial. 139. Indeed, Harbour\u2019s assertion in its letter of 9 September 2024 (pages 817 -821) that the outcome of the whole Directed Trial was based on the premise that the Harbour IA was enforceable (in its entirety ) is clearly wrong. The central dispute in the Directed Trial was the SFO\u2019s alleged entitlement to particular assets held directly or indirectly by Dr Smith and/or Dr Cochrane and/or other parties as against claims to them by third parties. The enforceabilit y of the entirety of the Harbour IA was not determined at the Directed Trial (pages 60 -279). 140. Moreover, the suggestion that Mr Thomas was required at the Directed Trial to argue that the relevant part(s) of the Harbour IA are unenforceable on the grounds set out herein (or, indeed, that it was even possible for him to do so) , is fanciful. Whatever the position with regard to knowledge of the PACCAR point (which is addressed above and by Mr Thomas in his witness statement ), it is important for the Court to understand the chronology , which I understand (from reviewing the relevant judgments) to be as A1.6/146 49 follows : 140.1. The Competition Appeal Tribunal\u2019s (\u201cCAT \u201d) judgment on the point at first instance was handed down on 28 October 2019 (pages 575 -627). The CAT held that litigation funding agreements such as the Harbour IA were not DBAs for the purposes of the CLSA 1990 and other relevant legislation. 140.2.

The Directed Trial Judgment was handed down on 18 May 2021 . As above, this was at a time when both the CAT and (more importantly) the Court of Appeal had positively determined that litigation funding agreements were not subject to the CLSA 1990 and/or the DBA Regs 2013. (pages 60 -279). 140.4. The Supreme Court appears to have given permission to appeal in the PACCAR litigation on 28 April 202215 and did not hear argument in PACCAR until February 2023 . The Supreme Court handed down its judgment on 26 July 2023 . (pages 675 -772). 141. Accordingly, at the time the Directed Trial Judgment was handed down by Mr Justice Foxton, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in the PACCAR litigation was the leading authority and was directly binding on the High Court . The idea that Mr Thomas was wrong not to have argued before Mr Justice Foxton for a position which , at the trial, would have been directly contrary to the CAT\u2019s ruling and which (by the time the decision was handed down) was directly contrary to a decision of the Court of Appeal is, I believe, simply untenable. 142. On the contrary, even if Mr Thomas had been aware of a PACCAR -style argument at the time of the Directed Trial, I respectfully suggest that the Court would no doubt have 15 https://www.supremecourt.uk/pta/permission -to-appeal -april-may-2022.html A1.6/147 50 rejected the argument instantly on the same grounds the CAT and Court of Appeal had rejected it (and, as above, was, by the time of handing down the Directed Trial Judgment, bound by higher authority in the form of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision ). 143. I believe that t he Court should also reject the overarching point made in Zoubir 20 at \u00a7\u00a7109-113 for the same reasons. (3) Estoppel by deed 144. In Zoubir 20 , Harbour raises (for the first time ) yet another potential argument \u2013 that Mr Thomas cannot challenge the enforceability of the Harbour IA because of the terms of the 2014 Harbour Deed he signed (see paragraph 45 above). This argument did not appear in the Pre -Action Correspondence or in the Draft Zoubir Statement . 145. The basis of the new estoppel by deed argument is set out in Zoubir 20 at \u00a797 as follows : \u201c... Mr Thomas (amongst others) agreed that the recoveries under the IOM Settlement were to be treated as \u201cProceeds received as a result of Success in the Proceedings\u201d for the purposes of Cl 9.1 of the Harbour IA and were to be applied in accordance with the terms of that clause. Accordingly, each of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas are estopped by deed from contesting that position. \u201d 146. This is fundamentally a point of law which will be addressed by Mr Thomas at the appropriate time. However, I note for now that Mr Zoubir fails altogether to explain (without limitation): 146.1. How those words could be said to give rise to",

This is fundamentally a point of law which will be addressed by Mr Thomas at the appropriate time. However, I note for now that Mr Zoubir fails altogether to explain (without limitation): 146.1. How those words could be said to give rise to an estoppel , still less one which could have the effect of supporting rights (in favour of Harbo ur) that are excluded by primary and secondary legislation ; 146.2. How such an estoppel could arise where the position fundamentally changed following the Supreme Court decision in PACCAR , which judgment did not exist in 2014 when the 2014 Harbour Deed was entered into; and/or 146.3. How the highlighted words of the 2014 Harbour Deed are said to be inconsistent with Mr Thomas now contending that Harbour is not entitled to enforce its alleged rights under the relevant parts of the Harbour IA. A1.6/148 51 147. Lastly, I note that Harbour continues to fail to explain the alleged basis (if any) for its (at present, wholly unarticulated) arguments concerning issue estoppel and/or cause of action estoppel. As I say above, it is unfair to Mr Thomas for Harbour to refuse to explain the grounds on which it brings the Harbour Application (and, assuming it is defended, resists the Thomas Cross -Application), and for Mr Thomas to be left to discover the nature of those grounds on the eve of a hearing when Harbour serves a s keleton argument. I. ORDER S / RELIEF SOUGHT 148. In the Pre -Action Correspondence and again in Zoubir 20, Harbour makes the claim that Mr Thomas has failed to set out the nature of the relief he intends to seek from the Court in relation to the Enforceability Applications. That is incorrect. My firm set out this position clearly in the Pre -Action Correspondence ( e.g. in paragraph 14 of MH\u2019s letter dated 25 September 2024 (page 824 )). Harbour\u2019s response to that letter, provided on 9 October 2024, merely repeated its (unmerited) accusation that, \u201c as we have already set out, it is your client who has failed to articulate the relief he seeks or its consequences in sufficient detail \u201d (\u00a74) (pages 829 -830), a claim repeated in Zoubir 20 . 149. Harbour\u2019s claim remains incor rect but, in any event, I summarise the specific relief sought below, which is also provided for in the draft order supplied with the Thomas Cross -Application. 150. I also note that the full relief sought in the draft order provided by Harbour with the Harbour Application was not fully articulated in the Pre -Action Correspondence . (1) Summary of declarations/primary relief sought 151. In summary, and w ithout prejudice to Mr Thomas\u2019 right to seek additional or other relief in due course, Mr Thomas presen tly seeks the following relief in the Thomas Cross - Application : 151.1. Declarations that: 151.1.1. Clauses 9.1(a) -(e) (or each of them) and Schedule 2 of the Harbour IA are unenforceable by Harbour against Mr Thomas (and/or all A1.6/149 52 funded parties to that contract) . 151.1.2. Alternatively, Clause 9.1(e) and Schedule 2 are unenforceable by Harbour against Mr Thomas (and/or all funded parties to that contract) . 151.1.3. Alternatively , Schedule 2 is unenforceable by Harbour against Mr Thomas (and/or all funded parties to that contract) . Mr Thomas contends that, in substance, this would produce essentially the same result as the declaration in",

Alternatively , Schedule 2 is unenforceable by Harbour against Mr Thomas (and/or all funded parties to that contract) . Mr Thomas contends that, in substance, this would produce essentially the same result as the declaration in paragraph 151.1.2 above where Clause 9.1(e) merely incorporates Schedule 2 (if enforceable) into the Waterfall. 151.1.4. Further or alternatively, Clauses 10.2, 12.1, and/or 14.4 are unenforceable by Harbour against Mr Thomas (and/or all funded parties to that contract) . 151.1.5. Consequently : 151.1.5.1. Harbour has no interest in (and is not entitled to) any part of the Proceeds or any payment under or in relation to the Harbour IA ; or 151.1.5.2. To the extent Harbour is able to save some but not all of the terms requiring payment to it, Harbour is not entitled to any other sums/payments under the Harbour IA. 151.2. If necessary, a n order (pursuant to paragraph 27 thereof) varying the Consequentials Order as set out below (or in such other ways or in other respects as the Court sees fit and/or is necessary to put the declarations listed above into legal and practical effect ). This is explained further below. 152. For obvious reasons, Mr Thomas also resists all of the relief sought by Harbour on the Harbour Application. A1.6/150 53 (2) Possible i mpact on the Consequentials Order 153. Mr Thomas has also considered the pote ntial impact of the relief sought in the Enforceability Applications on the Consequentials Order. 154. As a starting point, I note that ( as I say above ): 154.1. To the extent the Court considers it necessary to address the issue, Mr Thomas\u2019 application is made pursuant to the \u2018liberty to apply\u2019 provision at paragraph 27 of the Consequentials Order (page 12 ) because it pertains to the contractual documentation underpinning the Harbour Trust and Harbour\u2019s rights and/or interests (which are adverse to Mr Thomas\u2019 rights and/or interests) in respect of the same which are, in part, the subject of the Consequentials Order . 154.2. It is my understanding that, to date, no assets or funds within the Harbour Trust have yet been released to or realised by the Orb Claimants or Harbour pursuant to the Harbour IA . 154.3. I understand that the assets within the Harbour Trust are currently held or controlled by t he New Trustees , Joint Liquidators and/or Enforcement Receivers. 155. Mr Zoubir identifies in particular paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Consequentials Order (pages 6-7) as relevant to the relief sought by Mr Thomas . 156. Mr Thomas\u2019 primary position is that no amendments are required to the Consequentials Order to reflect the declarations sought by Mr Thom as where (if the d eclarations set out above are made) (i) Harbour can remain identified in paragraph 4 of the Consequentials Order as a beneficiary of the Harbour Trust but (ii) by reason of the declarations sought, is not entitled to any payments thereunder and/or does not have and/or is not entitled to vindicate or enforce any rights to as sets within the Harbour Trust. 157. However, if the Court considers it would be necessary to vary the Consequentials Order in the event the Thomas Cross -Application succeeds in full or in part, I envisage very A1.6/151 54 limited textual amendments could be made to give effect to the declarations sought. 158.

Specifically, and without prejudice to Mr Thomas\u2019 right to seek further or other amendments to the Consequentials Order as appropriate, I currently envisage that the following variations/amendments could be made to paragraphs 4 -5 ( the single suggested deletion being shown below in red struck -through text): \u201c4. The interests in the following assets are held by their legal owners on the terms of the Harbour Trust and are to be applied and apportioned between the beneficiaries, namely Harbour, Orb arl, and Messrs Thomas and Taylor, in accordance with those terms (save as set out below) ... [...] 5. Any share of the proceeds under the Harbour Trust which is attributable to Orb and Messrs Thomas and Taylor shall be adjusted as follows: a. The entitlement of Orb and Messrs Thomas and Taylor (after payment out of the prior items in the waterfall under the Harbour Trust)16 shall first be determined without any adjustments, based on the following percentages: 62.5% to Orb, 18.75% to Mr Thomas and 18.75% to Mr Taylor; [...] \u201d. 159. I do not consider it necessary for the Court to make any further amendments to the Consequentials Order (if indeed it is at all) . 160. The full relief sought by Mr Thomas is set out in the draft order accompanying the Thomas Cross -Application. 161. For completeness, it is possible that other parties to these and/or related proceedings whose interests are engaged by the Consequentials Order or other Orders made by the Court concerning Harbour, will wish to make submissions as to any other impacts on o r appropriate variations to the Consequentials Order or other Orders in light of the 16 These words in parentheses could be deleted in the event all of Clauses 9.1(a) -(e) (plus Schedule 2) are held unenforceable \u2013 such that the only distribution which falls to be made as part of Clause 9.1 is pursuant to Clause 9.1(f) \u2013 and the Court considers it necessary or desirable to do so .

I am not presently aware that any party currently wishes to do so and Mr Thomas\u2019 rights are fully reserved in relation to the same. (3) Counter -relief sought by Harbour 162. Finally, and for the record , I note that, upon issuing its application, Harbour has provided Mr Thomas with a proposed draft order setting out the full relief it seeks , together with unusual and extreme provisions such as (for example) (i) the \u201c totally without merit \u201d marker/declaration (\u00a72), and (ii) the asymmetrical \u201c liberty to apply \u201d provision in favour only of the Settlement Parties (as defined) and excluding Mr Thomas (\u00a77). Zoubir 20 does not even attempt to justify these ancillary provisions. 163. The relief sought by Harbour in its draft order is resisted by Mr Thomas in its totality. Mr Thomas reserves the right to make observations and raise objections as to the nature and/or form of the relief sought therein if and to the extent it becomes necessary in due course.

INTRODUCTION 1. I am a party to these proceedings . I am one of the Respondent s to an application by Harbour Fund II LP (\u201cHarbour \u201d) (the \u201cHarbour Application \u201d) and I make a cross - application in respect of the same matters (the \u201cThomas Cross -Application \u201d) (together, the \u201cEnforceability Applications \u201d). 2. The facts and matters set out in this statement are within my own knowledge, unless the contrary is expressly stated. Where they are within my own knowledge they are true to the best of my knowledge and belief. Where the facts and matters are not within my own knowledge, I give the source of my information and believe them to be true. 3. I refer to a paginated bundle of documents marked \u201cExhibit NT 4\u201d. It contains copies of the documents to which I refer in this statement. Unless the context makes otherwis e clear, references to page numbers in this statement are to \u201cExhibit NT 4\u201d. 4. In outline, the Enforceability Applications concern the enforceability (or otherwise) of the DBA element of the Harbour Investment Agreement dated 10 July 2013 (the \u201cHarbour IA\u201d) entered into by (among other people) Harbour and me . My solicitor, Ms Tamar Halevy, has provided a witness statement dated 28 November 2024 that addresses legal issues raised by the Enforceability Applications . This statement addresses some factual issues raised in the 20th witness statement dated 31 October 2024 of Mr Adam Zoubir , Harbour \u2019s solicitor, served in support of the Harbour Application (\u201cZoubir 20 \u201d), as follows: (1) First, I address the circumstances in which the Harbour IA was entered into and my no n-awareness in relation to the legal issues or arguments in the \u2018PACCAR \u2019 litigation up until judgment was handed down by the Supreme Court (R (on the application of P ACCAR Inc & Ors) v Competition Appeal Tribunal & Ors [2023] UKSC 28 (\u201cPACCAR \u201d)) (Section B below) . (2) Second, I address Harbour \u2019s attempt s to elide the conduct and positions of Dr Smith and Dr Cochrane with my conduct and my positions in these proceedings , including the repeated (and inaccurate) use by Mr Zoubir in Zoubir 20 of the Docusign Envelope ID: 328376DD-7C21-4C4F-BBD4-471C12A063FAA1.7/85 3 defined term, \u201cthe Smith Parties \u201d, when describing the conduct of one or more of Drs Smith and Cochrane, and me (Section C below ). (3) Third , I respond to other discrete aspects of Zoubir 20 insofar as I am best placed to address them (Section D below ). 5. I understand that n one of these matters",

(3) Third , I respond to other discrete aspects of Zoubir 20 insofar as I am best placed to address them (Section D below ). 5. I understand that n one of these matters are strictly relevant to the key points under consideration in the Enforceability Applications , but I address them here since Harbour has attempted to make them relevant in Zoubir 20. I leave the relevance issue s to my legal team to make submissions on as required . 6. In the interests of brevity, I respectfully ask that the Court rea ds Halevy 1 for an explanation of the background to the Enforceability Applications before considering this statement. For that reason, where I use capitalised terms in this short statement which are not defined in this document, I adopt the definitions provided in Halevy 1. B. THE \u2018PACCAR POINT \u2019 7. I first wish to address certain aspects of Mr Zoubir \u2019s comments to the effect that I knew or should have known about the potential P ACCAR argument (which I in fact discovered after the Supreme Court handed down its judgement in PACCAR) many years before I raised it. 8. I signed the Harbour IA in my individual capacity. I did so as a consumer and a lay person. Harbour proposed the terms set out in the Harbour IA on essentially a \u2018take it or leave it \u2019 basis in relation to the non -financial terms and we accepted those terms. At no point was I provided legal advice on the specific terms of the Harbour IA before or at the time of entering into it , and I did not question , nor did I have any reason to question, that Harbour had presented an enforceable contract for me to sign. 9. Against that background, Mr Zoubir says: (1) At \u00a735 of Zoubir 20: \u201cThe argument that the Harbour IA is a DBA has been available to the Orb Claimants since the agreement was first entered into and the possibility that the funding arrangements such as the Harbour IA were in fact subject to the DBA Regulations has been publicly debated in legal, academic and political circles Docusign Envelope ID: 328376DD-7C21-4C4F-BBD4-471C12A063FAA1.7/86 4 since at least 2014... \u201d (my emphasis) ; and 10. At \u00a798 of Zoubir 20: \u201cHarbou r's position is that the Orb Claimants could have argued that the Harbour IA was a DBA and sought to undermine Harbour \u2019s entitlement under the agreement at any time after it was agreed (although possibly not immediately) . The DBA Regulations entered into force on 1 April 2013, and the Harbour IA was executed on 10 July 2013. As set out above, it is accepted that at that point, not even the Government believed that the DBA Regulations were going to apply to litigation fund ing agreements .\u201d (my emphasis) . 11. I note that Mr Zoubir does not allege that I , in fact , knew of the P ACCAR point, nor that I should have known about it, at the outset of the Harbour IA. He alleges, in essence, that the potential P ACCAR argument was \u201cavaila ble\u201d to me in 2013 when the Harbour IA was signed (Zoubir 20, \u00a735); that it had been \u201cdebated in legal, academic and political circles \u201d since 2014 (Zoubir 20, \u00a735, \u00a7\u00a7101 -105); that until mid",

I do not address in this statement any of the legal submissions that will be made on my behalf in due course. However, for the avoidance of doubt: (1) I had no knowledge whatsoever when I signed the Harbour IA that the DBA element of it may not be enforceable in law, nor did I have any reason to suspect so. It was Harbour , a professional litigation funder that had obviously received extensive legal advice on its standards term agreement that it presented to me, who was best placed to know whether that agreement or its terms were (or may be) unenforceable. I relied on Harbour \u2019s standard terms being compliant with relevant legislation . My acceptance of Harbour \u2019s summary of the Harbour IA in its Statement of Case for the Directed Trial referred to in Zoubir 20 at \u00a7110 was based on this understanding . (2) I had no involvement in , or knowledge whatsoever of, the kind of debates in \u201clegal, academic and political circles \u201d Mr Zoubir alleges were occurring from around 2014. I am (and was at all times after I signed the Harbour IA) a lay businessperson, not a legal academic or practitioner. (3) I certainly had never read the article relied on by Mr Zoubir from Professor Docusign Envelope ID: 328376DD-7C21-4C4F-BBD4-471C12A063FAA1.7/87 5 Rachel Mulheron at that time (Mr Zoubir gives the title, \u201cEngland's unique approach to the self -regulation of third party funding: a critical analysis of recent developments \u201d). In this respect, Harbour refers to me having signed a letter to the Lord Chancellor in April 2024 (Zoubir 20, \u00a7103) which sought to oppose the litigation funding industry \u2019s attempts to lobby the then - Government to impose legislation to retrospectively reverse the effect of P ACCAR . That letter referred to Professor Mulheron \u2019s article from 2014. All that this letter shows is that, by April 2024 , I was aware of the P ACCAR decision and that Professor Mulheron had published a relevant article 10 years earlier. So far as I recall, I first discovered Professor Mulheron \u2019s article as a result of attending a litigation funding conference on 14 March 2024 (which I attended after I became aware of the Supreme Court \u2019s P ACCAR decision and began to appreciate its potential significance for the Ha rbour IA , as to which see below ), at which Professor Mulheron sat on a panel. I thereafter did some limited research on her and read a synopsis of a paper written by her (which I assume to be the article referred to in Zoubir 20 , although I do not recall precisely ). I did not read the article itself. This has no bearing whatsoever on Mr Zoubir \u2019s contention that I should have been aware many years prior to 2024 of Professor Mulheron \u2019s article (although I note he fails to explain why he says I should have bee n aware, and his suggestion",

      "text": "written by her (which I assume to be the article referred to in Zoubir 20 , although I do not recall precisely ). I did not read the article itself. This has no bearing whatsoever on Mr Zoubir \u2019s contention that I should have been aware many years prior to 2024 of Professor Mulheron \u2019s article (although I note he fails to explain why he says I should have bee n aware, and his suggestion that I should is, I believe, unreasonable ). (4) I had no awareness of the P ACCAR litigation while it was (as I now understand) underway in the Competition Appeal Tribunal and then the Court of Appeal, or indeed at any time before the Supreme Court handed down its judgment. As above, I only became aware of this case, and some of the possible implications for the Harbour IA , the day after the Supreme Court handed down its judgment in P ACCAR in July 2023 .Without any waiver of privilege, in July 2023 I was engaged in other litigation involving a litigation funder and was informed by that f under of the P ACCAR decision. It came as a surprise to me (and, I understand, to much of the litigation funding and legal industries) . Once I became aware of this decision I began to appreciate the potential implications for the Harbour IA. (5) Mr Zoubir also points out that, until mid -2016, I was represented by Stewarts. Docusign Envelope ID: 328376DD-7C21-4C4F-BBD4-471C12A063FAA1.7/88 6 This is correct; Stewarts acted for me in relation to the Original Proceedings against Mr Andrew Ruhan (explained in Halevy 1) , but n ot in relation to whether or not the Harbour IA or the DBA element of it was enforceable . Again, without waiving privilege, I did not seek or receive any advice from Stewarts about the enforceability of all or part of the Harbour IA because I was completely unaware of its potential unenforceability in the period that I was represented by the firm , for the reasons explained above . Further, and also without waiv ing privilege , I note a letter written by Stewarts (acting for me) and sent to MHS Sprecher Grier (acting for Harbour) in February 2017 about the Harbour IA (page s 2-21). That letter was very critical of Harbour but did not at any point raise the issue of the Harbour IA \u2019s enforceab ility. Mr Zoubir \u2019s suggestion in \u00a7106 of Zoubir 20, that Stewarts \u201cwere no doubt aware \u201d of the potential P ACCAR point, therefore appears to be baseless. That assertion is also inconsistent with the settled view at the time that such agreements were not DBAs that had to meet the requirements of the DBA Regs 2013. (6) In the context summarised above, I respectfully suggest i t is obvious that neither I nor my legal team was aware of the P ACCAR point until July 2023, at which point I took prompt steps to : take advice (privilege over which is not waived) ; raise the issue with Harbour, engage in the Pre -Action Correspondence set out in Halevy 1 ; and bring forward the Thomas Cross - Application. 13. For completeness, I note the apparent insinuation in the second and third sentences of \u00a7106 of Zoubir 20 that the O rb Claimants (as defined, including me) knew or suspected that the Harbour IA was not enforceable before 2016 but said nothing at that time so that Harbour would advance litigation funding on a false basis: \u201cI note that until mid -2016, the Orb Claimants we re",

It is also evident to me, however, that the Orb Claimants would have had no commercial interest seeking to undermine the Harbour IA while they were represented by Stewarts ...\u201d (emphasis added). 14. This is (if Mr Zoubir intends to make and stand by it) not a credible suggestion in the circumstances I have described above , particularly where Harbour was the party who proposed the terms and was a specialist and knowledgeable litigation funder, whereas I Docusign Envelope ID: 328376DD-7C21-4C4F-BBD4-471C12A063FAA1.7/89 7 was a lay person. 15. Indeed, I note that neither Mr Zoubir or an y person from Harbour has given evidence on whether (and if, so when) Harbour itself became aw are of the potential PACCAR point, whether as at the outset of the Harbour IA or from 2014 onwards. However, it seems to me that either: (1) Harbour was aware of the potential P ACCAR point either (i) at the outset of the Harbour IA, in which case it presented me with a contract which it had reasonable grounds to believe was not enforceable by it, or (ii) at some date between 2014 and the Directed Trial Judgment being handed down in 2021, and thus permitted the Court in the Directed Trial Proceedings to make unsustainable findings as to its entitlements under the Harbour IA on a (at least potentially) false premise; or (2) Harbour was not aware of the P ACCAR point at any of these points and did not become aware of it u ntil the Supreme Court decision , in which case Harbour is now arguing that I, a lay person and consumer, should have been aware of a highly technical legal argument about the enforceability of litigation funding agreements (whether when we signed the Harbour IA or from 2014) before Harbour, a specialist and market -leading litigation funder at the time, became aware of it. 16. There is at least some evidence to suggest that the first of these scenarios was the case in the peculiar language included by Harbour in Schedule 2 : 17. That language was: \u201cAt the date of this Agreement, the parties have agreed that the anticipated value of the Causes of Action is at least \u00a3100,000,000. On that basis, it is currently anticipated that, after any payments to HF2, the Claimants will receive at least 50% of the Proceeds includ ing where the multiple set out in this Schedule 2 is the applicable basis for calculating HF2's share of the Proceeds .\u201d 18. This appears to be an oblique reference to the requirement in Regulation 4(3) of the DBA Regs 2013 (explained in Halevy 1 ) which I unde rstand requir es that a DBA no t provide for payment above an amount which, including V AT, is equivalent to 50% of the sums ultimately recovered by the funded party. I can think of no other reason why the Harbour Docusign Envelope ID: 328376DD-7C21-4C4F-BBD4-471C12A063FAA1.7/90 8 IA would contain language such as this. I th erefore",

I th erefore believe that Harbour may have included these comments in Schedule 2 because it (unlike me) was aware of at least the possibility that the Harbour IA needed to comply with the DBA Regs 2013 . C. MR ZOUBIR \u2019S PREJUDICIAL COMMENTS ON THE PURPOSE OF MY APPL ICATION 19. In this section, I respond to Harbour \u2019s attempts in Zoubir 20 to provide the Court with prejudicial and inaccurate commentary about my involvement in these and other proceedings, and in particular the insinuation (for purely prejudicial purposes ) that my role in relation to the Enforceability Applications is, in effect, that of a puppet for Dr Gerald Smith. 20. Mr Zoubir seeks to encapsulate those prejudicial comments with the descriptor \u201cthe Smith Parties \u201d. He uses this defined term throughout Zoubir 20 to refer to me when he is in fact addressing the (alleged) conduct of Drs Cochrane and/or Smith , who I understand are ex - spouses (Zoubir 20, \u00a76). I reject this mischaracterisation of my distinct role and interest in these proceedings . I consider much o f Zoubir 20 to be an attempt to distract the Court from the substantive merits of my position (both in resisting the Harbour Application and in making the Thomas Cross -Application) . 21. For example, Mr Zoubir makes numerous allegations concerning the alleged c onduct of \u201cthe Smith Parties \u201d, including after the Directed Trial (e.g. Zoubir 20, Section D). However, as explained in paragraph 25 below, almost all of these allegations concern the behaviour of Dr Cochrane and/or Dr Smith alone which, although Mr Zoubir attempts to elide their actions with mine via his self -supplied def inition of \u201cthe Smith Parties \u201d, simply do not concern me and I had no role in bringing about . He also attempts to wrap into Harbour \u2019s conspiracy theory actions of mine which were undertaken simply in an attempt to vindicate my obvious commercial interests. Harbour \u2019s attempt to say that these actions were part of a wider conspiracy with Drs Cochrane and Smith, for an improper purpose, is wrong and, indeed, simply illogical. 22. The high point of this conspiracy theory is at paragraph 51 of Zoubir 20: \u201cIt is clear from this correspondence and my prior knowledge of these proceedings that the actions of Dr Cochrane and Mr Thomas are being orchestrated by Dr Smith in order to force the Settlement Parties, including Harbour to expend further time and costs and to erode the Docusign Envelope ID: 328376DD-7C21-4C4F-BBD4-471C12A063FAA1.7/91 9 value of the assets under the management of the various office holders, and, via threats of interminable legal action by Dr Smith and/or his prox ies, to pressurise the Settlement Parties into foregoing the fruits of their success at the Directed Trial .\u201d (my emphasis) . 23. That is false. In making and defending the Enforceability Applications, I am not acting on behalf of or somehow as a proxy for Dr S mith or Dr Cochrane and neither of them are \u201corchestrating \u201d my actions . I am simply defending my own interests in the Proceeds. 24. In reality, Zoubir 20 presents a jumble of different",

I am simply defending my own interests in the Proceeds. 24. In reality, Zoubir 20 presents a jumble of different alleged activities , undertaken by different commercial parties with differ ing commercial interests, as a single unified strategy by using the \u201cSmith Parties \u201d label . The vagueness and convenience (for Harbour) of this label is highlighted in Zoubir 20 at \u00a76, which does not even limit the number of people whose action s it intends to capture as part of the alleged conspiracy : \u201cThis application has been necessitated by the actions and conduct of the now thrice - convicted fraudster, Dr Gerald Smith (\u201cDr Smith \u201d), and parties and entities closely associated with him, includi ng but not limited to his ex -wife, Dr Gail Cochrane (\u201cDr Cochrane \u201d) and Messrs Nicholas Thomas and Roger Taylor (\u201cMessrs Thomas and Taylor \u201d), (together \u201cthe Smith Parties \u201d)\u201d (my emphasis) 25. I am also concerned that Harbour \u2019s alleged conspiracy does not appea r to even be supported by the actions cited by Mr Zoubir in his statement in support of the same (notwithstanding his use of \u201cthe Smith Parties \u201d when describing them ): (1) Most of the alleged conduct relied on by Mr Zoubir plainly has nothing to do with me . For example : a. Dr Cochrane \u2019s alleged resistance of \u201csteps \u201d taken by the Enforcement Receivers (\u00a750.1); b. The alleged failure of Dr Smith \u201cand others \u201d (but not including me) to give vacant possession of some properties in breach of a court order (\u00a750.2) and Dr Smith \u2019s arguments about his apparent \u201crights over \u201d these properties (\u00a750.19); c. Dr Smith being convicted of contempt of court in July 2022 (\u00a750.6) and facing further contempt of court accusations by the SFO in October 2024 Docusign Envelope ID: 328376DD-7C21-4C4F-BBD4-471C12A063FAA1.7/92 10 (\u00a750.16) ;1 d. Dr Smith being c onvicted of fraud in July 2024 in connection with COVID -19 Bounce Back Loan s (\u00a750.1 5); e. Drs Smith and Cochrane (i.e. not including me) commencing an arbitration and having an anti -arbitration injunction made against them (\u00a750.12); f. Dr Cochrane \u2019s so-called Sl ip Rule Application (\u00a750.13) . Zoubir 20 explains in \u00a7\u00a764 -71 the basis and outcome of the Slip Rule Application by Dr Cochrane. Mr Zoubir explains that this was an application by which Dr Cochrane sought to amend the Consequentials Order to have Orb removed from the list of Non -Arena Companies . These paragraphs of Zoubir 20 recognise that I had nothing to do with that application and had no interest in its outcome . Indeed, the excerpt in \u00a768 of Zoubir 20 shows adverse findings as to apparent cooperation between Dr Smith and Dr Cochrane in relation to Dr Cochrane \u2019s Slip Rule Application , but makes no reference to me at all in this respect ; g. Arguments run by Dr Cochrane with respect to the LCL Settlement Agreement (as defined in Zoubir 20) (\u00a750.17) , which (a s I explain below) I was not a party to and had no involvement in agreeing , notwithstanding Mr Zoubir \u2019s attempts throughout his statement to refer to \u201cthe Smith Parties \u201d in relation to the LCL Settlement ; and h.

Zoubir 20 at \u00a750, to which I object f or the reasons set out in paragraph 23 above; and c. Zoubir 20 at \u00a786: \u201cIt has become apparent to Harbour, and to me, that the Smith Parties , in particular Dr Smith and Dr Cochrane , have never intended to honour the terms of the LCL Settlement Agreement) \u201d and \u201cWhile no party has formally sought to challenge the validity of the LCL Settlement Agreement, several of the Smith Parties have acted in clear breach of its terms \u201d (my emphases) . Mr Zoubir obviousl y cannot (legitimately) criticise me for not complying with a settlement agreement to which I am not and have never been a party, and his use of the words \u201cin particular Dr Smith and Dr Cochrane \u201d and \u201cseveral of the Smith Parties \u201d obscure my non-role in the LCL Settlement Agreement to preserve Harbour \u2019s prejudicial \u201cthe Smith Parties \u201d descriptor . (3) There are certain other alleged events raised by Mr Zoubir that do relate to me. Whilst those events are more factually complicated than Mr Zoubir suggests (as to which I reserve my rights to respond if necessary), none of them support Mr Zoubir \u2019s conspiracy theory that my actions are \u201corchestrated \u201d by Dr Smith and/or I am merely one of his \u201cproxies \u201d. I have my own real and legitimate interests in re lation to the Harbour Trust and the Harbour IA which are (as Harbour readily accepts) in conflict with Harbour \u2019s interests. 26. It is simply inaccurate to describe me as one of \u201cthe Smith Parties \u201d in this case . I have an obvious and direct commercial interest in these Enforceability Applications (and other applications) myself as one of the original Claimants in the Original Proceedings and /or as one of the beneficiaries of the Harbour Trust/Proceeds .

All I seek in the Enforceability Applications is to prevent Harbour from enforcing the DBA element of the Harbour IA and thereby taking a substantial portion of the Proceeds to which I would otherwise be entitled, because Harb our\u2019s standard form litigation funding agreement now appears not to comply with regulatory requirements and, as a result, to be partly unenforceable, as explained in Halevy 1. That is, I believe , a completely proper course of action for me to have taken, a nd in no way an improper purpose . 28. It seems to me that Harbour \u2019s strategy in large portions of Zoubir 20 is simply to raise as many prejudicial (and untrue) points as possible to distract the Court from the relevant substantive issues between Harbour and m e. Those issues are covered in full in Halevy 1 and concern , only : (i) the compliance of the DBA element of the Harbour IA with the relevant legislation; (ii) the consequences of that non -compliance; (iii) Harbour \u2019s legal argument that it is possible to se ver the illegal or unenforceable parts ; and (iv) even if the DBA is unenforceable , whether I should be prevented from making the argument that it is unenforceable and the Court should simply rubber stamp the DBA as though it was enforceable , on technical grounds such as limitation, abuse and estoppel . 29. I wish to add by way of final comment that, although I have attempted to address in outline terms the attempts by Mr Zoubir to implicate me in the wrongful actions of others and to thereby cast doubt on the reasons for my involvement in the Enforceability Applications , I have not provided a line -by-line response to the relevant parts of Zoubir 20. I do not consider it is proportionate or appropriate to do so given their irrelevance to the Enforc eability Applications (which I understand, at their core, concern technical legal issues dealing with the consequences of the P ACCAR decision ) and the sheer volume of prejudicial commentary in Zoubir 20. To be clear, where I have not specifically addressed above a point in Zoubir 20, that should not be taken as an acceptance of the truth of the allegation or of its relevance to the Enforceability Applications. D. OTHER DISCRETE ISSUES 30. In this short section , I address some discrete factual issues raised in Zoub ir 20 on which I Docusign Envelope ID: 328376DD-7C21-4C4F-BBD4-471C12A063FAA1.7/95 13 am best placed to comment. 31. First, I note paragraph 70 of Zoubir 20, which says: \u201cPerhaps in response to the concerns raised by the Jersey Court over her characterisation of the ownership of Orb, Dr Cochrane \u2019s position in Jersey has more recently developed, such that she now concedes that \u201cit is correct that paragraph 16 of the Order of Foxton J dated 11 June 2021\u2026 states that Dr Smith holds 100% of the equitable interest of the shares in the Non -Arena Companies (listed in Schedule",

However, in order to maintain her position in respect of Orb \u2019s recall application, Dr Co chrane now argues that \u201cthe Directed Trial did not determine the ownership of the assets owned by the Non -Arena Companies \u201d, which, for the first time, she now asserts \u201care held on resulting trust of [sic] the benefit of the Orb Claimants \u201d. (page 1061) Dr C ochrane has not yet elucidated how her arguments regarding Orb are to her own benefit, given that she holds no interest in Orb, and it is not a fully accurate statement in any event, given that the IUAs (which the Directed Trial did determine ownership of) were owned by various Non -Arena Companies .\u201d (my emphasis) 32. I understand that this issue is not material to the Enforceability Applications . However, in the interests of factual accuracy, I note that , although Harbou r is correct that the ownership of the sh ares in the Non -Arena Companies was determined by Mr Justice Foxton in the Directed Trial Judgment, ownership of the assets said to be held by those Non -Arena Companies (i.e. the Non -Arena Assets) was not so determined . 33. This was confirmed by Mr Justice Fo xton in an email from his clerk timed at 15:32 on 22 June 2021 (pages 22-30): \u201cThe Judge has now reviewed the submissions from the parties on the terms of the order and has approved the order in the terms of the attached draft. His brief reasons for the decision appear below... [...] The declaration concerns only the shares in the N on Arena Companies and says nothing about anybody \u2019s claim to underlying assets of those companies. No language addressing proprietary claims to underlying assets is required .\u201d 34. Although that resolves the issue, I note that it was further recognised by a let ter dated 24 July 2024 sent to me by Stephenson Harwood LLP on behalf of the Enforcement Receivers (pages 39-40), which noted at \u00a74.2: \u201cAs recorded at paragraph 16 of the order made on 11 June 2021, the Directed Trial did determine ownership of the share i n CCBV (finding that it was held by Dr Cochrane as nominee for Dr Smith, such that 100% of the equitable interest is Dr Smith's realisable property) but did Docusign Envelope ID: 328376DD-7C21-4C4F-BBD4-471C12A063FAA1.7/96 14 not determine ownership of any assets held by CCBV (as you have noted). \u201d2 35. The reference to \u2018CCBV \u2019 was to Casa Coloniches B.V ., one of the Non -Area Companies. 36. Finally, I note Mr Zoubir makes a series of comments on the extent to which Harbour relied on the Harbour IA (which, as above, I believe to be its standard form contract from that time , and was drafted by Harbour ) to its detriment, with a view to persuading the Court that, whatever the merits of the Enforceability Applic ations, it would be unfair for Harbour to be deprived of the sums it claims under the DBA element of the Harbour IA. 37.

Although this is , again, irrelevant to the substance of the Enforceability Applications, I would briefly make the following additional observations: (1) Whilst it may be a matter for legal submissions in due course, I understand that the purpose of the legislation set out in Halevy 1 is to protect lay people and/or consumers like me when accessing the kinds of services it regulates (including the services Harbour provides). I find it difficult to see how Harbour can fairly complain about the lega l effect of its own failure: it s standard term agreement failing to comply with regulatory requirements . (2) Second, I note that, whilst the Original Proceedings were settled many years ago, I to date have still received nothing from the Proceeds of those Ori ginal Proceedings. I have therefore been kept out of my share of those Proceeds for a very long time myself . (3) Third , the Court is asked to note precisely what Harbour says it is entitled to under the DBA element of the Harbour IA (and considers it unfair t hat it now does not have). I respectfully refer the Court to a letter dated 2 July 2021 from Harcus Parker (on behalf of Harbour) to my former solicitors (pages 31 -38). In that letter: a. Harbour asserted that the total estimated realisable value of the asset s held within the Harbour Trust pursuant to the Harbour IA at that time 2 I make no further comment on the other aspects of this letter given t heir apparent irrelevance to the Enforceability Applications. Docusign Envelope ID: 328376DD-7C21-4C4F-BBD4-471C12A063FAA1.7/97 15 was \u00a323,865,935.70; b. Harbour went on in that letter to state that, on the assumption its valuation was correct (which is disputed), the minimum to which Harbour would be entitled under the Harbour IA was \u00a325,945,052.40; and c. On this basis, Harbour considered it was entitled to take the entirety of the Proceeds (as defined) and I, together with the other funded parties to the Harbour IA, should receive nothing from the Proceeds of the Original Proceedings in which we were the Claimants. 38. Accordingly, to the extent it is relevant, I do not accept Mr Zoubir \u2019s suggestion that Harbour is the (or a) victim of its own failure to ensure that the Harbour IA complied with regulatory requirements aimed at preventing precisely the kind of behaviour \u2013 riding roughshod over the interests of lay consumers \u2013 illustrated in paragraph 37(3) above . STATEMENT OF TRUTH I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true. I understand that proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes, or c auses to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.
