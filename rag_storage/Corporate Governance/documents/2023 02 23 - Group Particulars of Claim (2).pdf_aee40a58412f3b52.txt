undergraduate or graduate students at the Defendant in one or more of the 
four academic years 2017 -18, 2019 -20, 2020 -21 and 2021 -22. Insofar as the 
Claimants are presently able , Appendix  2 identifies  in which  year or years

each Claimant was enrolled.  
 
2. The Defendant ( UCL ) is a company incorporated by Royal Charter and an 
exempt  charity  under  the terms  of the Charities  Act 2011 , Schedule 3 . It is 
regulated  by the Office for Students. UCL is the second largest university in 
the United Kingdom, by student population. At all material times, UCL 
offered undergraduate and  graduate higher education courses in multipl e 
academic  
2  disciplines.  According  to UCL’s  financial  statements  and its website,  across 
the period in question:  
 
a. UCL’s income from tuition fees and education contracts has risen 
from £521m in 2018 to £733m in 2021.  
 
b. UCL’s  total student  numbers  have  increa sed from  41,539  in 2018  to 
48,168 in 2021.  
 
The Contracts  
 
3. By accepting  an offer  to study  at UCL,  each Claimant  entered  into a contract 
with UCL pursuant to which the Claimant agreed to pay tuition fees and 
UCL  agreed  to provide  the Claimant  with tuition  and related  services  (each 
a Contract  and, together,  the Contracts ). The Contract  was entered  into, in 
each case, on the date on which the offer was accepted, as to which:  
 
a. In respect  of the majority  of undergraduates,  who applied  in or about 
January and r eceived their last UCAS application decision in or 
about May,  the deadline  for accepting  an offer  was in or  about June 
of the calendar year in which they commenced their studies. The 
specific deadlines were:  
 
 
4 June 2015  For undergraduates  commencing  in 2015- 
2016 (who were in their third year by 
2017 -18) 
 
8 June 2016  For undergraduates  commencing  in 2016 - 
2017 (who were in their second year by 
2017 -18) 
8 June 2017  For undergraduates  commencing  in 2017 - 
18 
4 June 2018  For undergraduates  commencing  in 2018- 
19 
6 June 2019  For undergraduates  commencing  in 2019 - 
20 
18 June 2020  For undergraduates  commencing  in 2020 - 
21 
3   
10 June 2021  For undergraduates  commencing  in 2021 - 
22 
 
 
b. Offer acceptance occurred a year earlier than the dates pleaded at 
paragraph  3.a above  in respect  of undergraduates  who elected  to defer 
by a year, and some weeks later than such dates for undergraduates 
who applied later or received an offer through Clearing.  
 
c. In respect of applicants for graduate courses, UCL informed each 
applicant of the date by which they had to respond to UCL’s offer.  
 
4. Each Contract incorporated the version of UCL’s standard terms and 
conditions  (the Standard  Terms ) applicable  to undergraduates  or graduates 
(as relevant), at the time it was entered into.  
 
5. All versions of the Standard Terms required the Claimants to pay “ Tuition 
Fees ”, defined  (in all Standard  Terms,  save for undergraduate terms applicable 
in 2017 -18 and earlier and graduate  terms  appli cable  in 2019 -20 and earlier) 
as “fees that are directly related to us providing you with tuition and 
learning support connected to your Programme ”. Tuition Fees were payable 
for each year of study, as to which:  
 
a. In respect of UK/EU undergraduates at all m aterial times, and 
overseas undergraduates commencing in 2018 -19 or later, the 
amount  of Tuition  Fees applicable  throughout  was fixed  by reference 
to the level of Tuition Fees applicable in the first academic year of 
study; and  
 
b. In respect of overseas unde rgraduates commencing in 2017 -18 or 
earlier,  and all graduates  at all material  times,  the amount  of Tuition 
Fees was identified in the first academic year of study and such 
figure  was thereafter  subject  to a potential  increase  of up to 5% each 
year.  
4  6. The annual  Tuition  Fee for full time UK/ EU undergraduates  was £9,000  in 
and before 2016 -17 and £9,250 in and after 2017 -18 (being the maximum 
permitted  by the Higher  Education  and Research  Act 2017).  Annual  Tuition 
Fees for overseas undergraduates and for UK/E U and overseas graduates 
varied  depending  on the programme  undertaken  but, in every  case,  exceeded  
£9,250  for full  time courses.  
 
7. The Standard Terms for both undergraduates and graduates commencing 
courses in 2015 -16, 2016 -17, and 2017 -18 included the foll owing terms:  
 
a. Clause 7.3(1): “ UCL will provide you with tuition, learning 
opportunities  and other  related  services  relevant  to your programme 
and modules. Specific details relating to the delivery of your 
programme will be provided before or at the time of  your 
registration on your programme. ” 
 
b. Clause 7.9(1): “ You will have access to UCL’s Library facilities 
while you are a registered student at UCL. ” 
 
8. The Standard  Terms  for graduates  commencing  courses  in 2018 -19 and 
2019 -20 included (as  clause  13) the term quoted  in paragraph  7.a above  save 
that the word “ programme ” was capitalised, and (as clause 27) the term 
quoted in paragraph 7.b above.  
 
 
9. The Standard Terms for undergraduates commencing courses in 2018 -19 
and 2019 -20 inclu ded the following terms (emphasis in original):  
 
“3.1 UCL  commits  to: 
5  3.1.1 provide you with tuition and learning support connected 
with the Programme  that you are studying,  with reasonable 
care and skill;  
 
More  detailed  information  about  the different  aspects  of your 
Programme (including current expectations in relation to 
modules and assessment method(s)) is provided in UCL’s 
Undergraduate Prospectus applicable to your start date;  
 
3.1.2 make available appropriate infrastructure and facilities to 
support your learni ng; 
 
This includes your use of teaching and learning space, 
UCL’s libraries and IT facilities in accordance with the 
Student Regulations. ” 
 
10. The Standard  Terms  for undergraduates  commencing  courses in  2020 -21 and 
2021 -22 included  the following  terms  (emphas is in original):  
 
“3.1     UCL  commits  to: 
 
3.1.1 provide the services relevant to your Programme with 
reasonable care and skill.  
 
More  detailed  information  about  the different  aspects  of your 
Programme (including current expectations in relation to 
modules and assessment method(s)) is provided in UCL’s 
Prospectus for Undergraduates applicable to your start 
date. This includes tuition and learning support.  
 
3.1.2 make available reasonably appropriate infrastructure and 
facilities to support your learning.  
 
This include s, as appropriate, use of teaching and learning 
space, UCL’s libraries and IT facilities in accordance with 
the Student Regulations and Policies. ” 
 
11. The Standard Terms for graduates commencing courses in 2020 -21 and 
2021 -22 included the following terms (emp hasis in original):  
 
“3.1 UCL  commits  to: 
 
3.1.1 provide the services relevant to your Programme with 
reasonable care and skill.  
 
More  detailed  information  about  the different  aspects  of your 
Programme (including current expectations in relation to 
modules and a ssessment method(s)) is provided in UCL’s 
6  Prospectus for Graduates applicable to your start date. If 
you are undertaking a taught Programme, this includes 
tuition and learning support. If you are undertaking a 
research Programme, this includes an appropria te 
supervisory team;  
 
3.1.2 make available reasonably appropriate infrastructure and 
facilities to support your learning.  
 
This includes, as appropriate, use of teaching and learning 
space, UCL’s libraries and IT facilities in accordance with 
the Student Regulat ions and Policies. ” 
 
12. All versions  of the Standard  Terms  provided  that the contractual  relationship 
between  each Claimant  and UCL  was governed  by English  law, and that the 
courts of England and Wales had jurisdiction over any disputes between 
them.  
 
13. Prior t o March 2020:  
 
a. All or substantially all of the tuition provided by UCL to undergraduates 
and graduates (for example lectures, seminars, tutorials and other study 
groups) was provided on campus and in person; and  
 
b. Students had physical access to the facilit ies provided by UCL to 
support their learning, such as libraries and laboratories.  
 
14. The provision  by UCL  described  in paragraph  13 above  was consistent  with 
the way in which the majority of universities in the UK had, until Ma rch 
2020, provided tuition and related services. Such provision was distinct in 
both respects from “ distance learning ” offered by, for example, The Open 
University whose qualifications are (according to its website) priced at “ two-
thirds of the cost [to a UK student] of an equivalent qualification offered at 
a campus -based university ”. 
 
15. The Claimants rely on the full content of the UCL Undergraduate and 
Graduate Prospectuses for the academic years 2015 -16 to 2022 -23 as 
material  relevant  to the construction  of the Contracts.  Such  material  includes 
the Prospectus relevant to the academic year of commencement and the 
7  Prospectus  for the subsequent  academic  year (which  was published  some  18 
months ahead). Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the 
Claimants rely in particular on the matters in paragraphs 16 to 24 below.  
 
16. The UCL Undergraduate Prospectus for each of the academic years 2015 - 
16 to 2022 -23 contained  photographs  of students  receiving  tuition  in person 
and enjoying physical access to UCL’s facilities, such as libraries and 
laboratories.  
 
17. The UCL Undergraduate Prospectus for each of the academic years 2015 - 
16 to 2022 -23 emphasised the importance to the student experience of 
UCL’ s location  in London  and its on-site or nearby  facilities.  For example:  
 
a. 2015 -16 to 2018 -19: “ We’re based in the heart of London – giving 
you outstanding academic, professional and social benefits ” (or 
materially similar words);  
 
b. 2015 -16 to 2018 -19: “ UCL’s  Bloomsbury campus has various 
resources to make your studies enjoyable and effective as well as 
enabling  you to make  the most  of your free time.  All you need  to fulfil 
your potential is here, right at the heart of one of the world’s great 
capital cities. ” (or materially similar words);  
 
c. 2015 -16 to 2018 -19: “ As well as being open to the public, UCL’s 
diverse  museums  and collections  (see list on the right)  are often  used 
as teaching resources. ” 
 
d. 2015 -16 to 2018 -19: “ At UCL, you don’t just learn it, you can l ive 
it[.] The resources  for learning  you can enjoy  in London  are many  and 
varied. ” 
 
e. 2019 -20 and 2020 -21: “ UCL is in the heart of London – and your 
life with us in London is at the heart of your UCL education. ” 
 
f. 2021 -22: “Our Bloomsbury  campus  is a calm  haven in the bustling 
heart of London, and your life in the city is a crucial part of your 
8  UCL education. ” 
 
g. 2022 -23: “ Your life in London is a crucial part of your education 
and you will have the opportunity to study, live and play in not just 
one iconic part  of London but two, with the opening of our new 
campus in Stratford to complement our established home in 
Bloomsbury. ” 
 
h. Each  UCL  Undergraduate  Prospectus  for the academic  years  2019 - 
20 to 2022 -23 contained  a section  entitled,  “London  is your 
classroom ”. 
 
18. From  2019 -20 onwards,  UCL’s  Undergraduate  Prospectuses  highlighted  the 
‘Transforming  UCL’  project,  pursuant  to which  UCL  was investing  over 
£1.2 billion  to create  new sustainable  spaces  and facilities,  including  a new 
Student Centre with over 1,000 study s paces.  
 
19. UCL’s Undergraduate Prospectus for each of the academic years 2015 -16 to 
2020 -21 advertised the extensive library resources available to students. For 
example:  
 
a. 2015 -16: “ With more than two million books and subscriptions to 
more than 12,000 journa ls in a combination of electronic and print 
formats, UCL  Library  Services  gives  you access  to a vast range  of 
resources across all subject areas. We have 15 specialist libraries 
with valuable and historic material housed in Special Collections .” 
 
b. 2016 -17: “With more than two million books and subscriptions to 
more than 35,000 journals in a combination of electronic and print 
formats, UCL Library Services gives you access to a vast range of 
resources across all subject areas. We have 16 specialist libraries,  
with valuable  and historic  material  housed  in Special  Collections.  A 
number  of our libraries  are open  24 hours,  with world -class  learning 
facilities and services .” 
 
9  c. 2017 -18 and 2018 -19: “ Having been open for nearly 200 years 
we’ve acquired millions  of boo ks and tens of  thousands of  journals, 
and these can be found across our 18 specialist libraries. These days, 
we also offer a large range of online resources which can be 
accessed from anywhere in the world. More historic and valuable 
material can be reques ted from our store outside London, and 
viewed in our Special Collections, and we regularly display rare 
items in our annual exhibitions and research sessions. A number of 
our libraries are open throughout the night. ” (or materially similar 
words);  
 
d. 2019 -20: “Our students  have access  to 18 specialist  libraries,  as well 
as some impressive spaces devoted to studying and collaborating. 
UCL Libraries hold a vast collection of books and journals as well 
as online resources that can be accessed from anywhere in th e 
world. Historic and  valuable material can be requested and  viewed  
in our Special  Collections  Reading  Room,  and we regularly  display 
rare items in our annual exhibitions and research sessions. ” 
 
e. 2020 -21: “Our students  have access  to 16 specialist  librarie s, as well 
as some impressive spaces devoted to studying and collaborating – 
including,  of course,  1,000  new study  spaces  in the Student  Centre. ” 
 
20. The UCL Undergraduate Prospectus for each of the academic years 2015 - 
16 to 2022 -23 stated that UCL guarantee d residential accommodation to 
undergraduate students in their first year of study, subject to certain 
conditions. In each such prospectus, the centrality within London or 
convenience of such accommodation for “ the Bloomsbury campus ” was 
referred to.  
 
21. The UCL Graduate Prospectus for each of the academic years 2015 -16 to 
2020 -21 contained  a section  entitled  “The London  advantage ” in respect  of 
each faculty,  which  set out the benefits  to that faculty’s  graduate  students  of 
being London -based.  
 
10  22. The UCL Graduat e Prospectus for each of the academic years 2015 -16 to 
2020 -21 contained a section on “ Distance Learning ”, which stated that a 
number  of UCL  graduate  programmes  could  be taken  on a distance  learning 
basis, whereby some or all of the teaching would be deliv ered online. The 
specific programmes for which Distance Learning was available were 
identified.  None of the Claimants who were graduates chose such a 
programme.  
 
23. None  of the UCL  Undergraduate  Prospectuses  for the academic  years  2015 - 
16 to 2022 -23 advertis ed any of its courses  as being  available  on a Distance 
Learning basis.  
 
24. There was no published UCL Graduate Prospectus for the academic years 
2021 -22 or 2022 -23. Information  for prospective  graduate  students  was 
available online only, at www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective -students/graduate/ . 
Until  October  2020,  the webpage  included  sections  on “Campus  facilities ”, 
“Living in London ”, and “ How UCL students excel in London ”. From around 
the end of October 2020 onwards, the webpage included a section on  “Your  
life in London ”, which  stated  the following  (or words  to materially similar 
effect):  
 
“UCL provides students with a wealth of services and facilities to 
meet their cultural, social and leisure i nterests as well as their 
practical needs. Campus life is lively and varied, with a choice of 
social spaces and a huge variety of events on offer including talks, 
exhibitions and workshops. ” 
 
25. In the premises and on the true construction of the terms quoted  at 
paragraphs  7 to 11 above,  UCL  owed  a contractual  duty to each Claimant  to 
provide them with (i) in -person, campus -based tuition and (ii) physical 
access  to facilities  to support the  Claimant’s  learning. Without  prejudice to 
the generality of the foregoing:  
 
a. UCL  and those  Claimants  who entered into  Contracts  before  March 
2020 intended and expected those terms to have such a meaning.  
 
b. UCL did not materially amend the Standard Terms and used 
11  mater ially the same language in Contracts entered into after March 
2020. The meaning of the Standard Terms did not change, as 
reinforced by the unchanged messages in UCL’s Prospectuses.  
 
26. Alternatively, it was an implied term of each Contract that UCL would 
provide the Claimant with in -person, campus -based tuition and physical 
access to facilities to support the Claimant’s learning. Such a term was 
implied on grounds that it was obvious.  
 
Industrial  action  
 
Academic  year  2017 -18 
 
27. During the academic year 2017 -18, the University and College Union 
(UCU ) called  on its members  to take industrial  action  in support  of a dispute 
about proposed changes to a pension scheme known as the Universities 
Superannuation Scheme ( USS). 
 
28. Teaching  staff at UCL  who were  members  of UCU  went  on strike  for a total 
of 14 teaching days. The dates of the industrial action were 22 and 23 
February, 26 to 28 February, 5 to 8 March, and 12 to 16 March 2018.  
 
Academic  year  2019 -20 
 
29. During the academic year 2019 -20, UCU called on its members to ta ke 
further  industrial  action  in a dispute  regarding  pay and working  conditions.  
 
30. Teaching  staff at UCL  who were  members  of UCU  went  on strike  for a total 
of 20 teaching  days.  The dates  of the industrial  action  were  25 November  to 
4 December  2019,  24 to 26 February  2020,  2 to 5 March  2020,  and 9 to 13 
March  2020 . 
 
Academic  year  2021 -22 
 
31. During the academic year 2021 -22, UCU again called on its members to 
take industrial action in connection with disputes about USS pension 
changes, and pay and working conditi ons. 
12   
32. Teaching  staff at UCL  who were  members  of UCU  went  on strike  for a total 
of 13 teaching  days.  The dates  of the industrial  action  were  1 to 3 December 
2021, 21 to 22 February 2022, 28 February to 2 March 2022, and 21 to 25  
March  2022.  
 
33. On each of the days on which industrial action took place in each of the 
academic years identified above, teaching at UCL was disrupted and a 
material proportion of lectures, tutorials and other forms of teaching was 
cancelled. The Claimants will plead further particular s as to the courses on  
which teaching was cancelled upon disclosure (or sooner provision of 
relevant information by UCL).   
 
Tuition  Fees  during  industrial  action  
 
34. UCL charged and collected Tuition Fees in full notwithstanding the lost 
teaching days particu larised above. While UCL had a ‘Learning 
Opportunities Fund’ to which students could apply for a maximum award of 
£500  if their learning  had been affected  by the industrial  action,  applicants had 
to indicate how they would use any funds awarded and provide  estimates  for 
the costs  of the learning  resources  they required.  The Learning Opportunities 
Fund did not support requests for Tuition Fee refunds or compensation. UCL 
did not offer any automatic or universal Tuition Fee reduction or rebate to 
students aff ected by the industrial action.  
 
Covid -19 
 
Academic  year  2019 -20 
 
35. On 13 March  2020,  in response  to the continuing  spread  of Covid -19, UCL 
announced  (with  immediate  effect)  that “Face -to-face teaching  is suspended 
for the remainder of this academic year.  The university is adopting online 
alternatives for teaching and assessments wherever possible .” 
 
36. On 17 March  2020,  UCL  announced  the closure,  by 20 March  2020,  of most 
university  buildings  including  all libraries.  The Student  Centre  closed  on 23 
13  March 2020.  
 
37. In the academic year 2019 -20, in line with the announcements referred to 
above,  for part of Term  Two (16 to 27 March  2020)  and the whole  of Term 
Three (27 April to 12 June 2020):  
 
a. UCL  did not provide  the Claimants  with any in-person,  campus - 
based tuition  and, instead, provided only online tuition.  
 
b. UCL  did not provide  physical  access  to facilities  to support  the 
Claimants’ learning.  
 
Academic  year  2020 -2021  
 
38. On 1 June 2020, the UCL website published an update from Professor 
Anthony Smith, Vice Provost (Ed ucation & Student Affairs) for students 
arriving at or returning to UCL for the 2020 -21 academic year, which 
included the following message:  
 
“As the pandemic progresses, social distancing requirements will 
guide how much teaching we can deliver in person at any given 
time.  In order  to give you the best education,  we will support  your 
learning through:  
 
 High -quality online lectures to ensure you can get to grips 
with the material  you’re  working  on before  you discuss  your 
ideas with your tutors and your peer s. 
 Interactive sessions , online or in person, where you’ll be 
guided and challenged in discussion with peers and experts 
in your field.  
 Sessions on campus such as small -group seminars, lab 
practicals  and studio  work  where  social -distancing  permits . 
If you aren’t able to join us in London immediately, we will 
provide alternative content so you can achieve the same 
learning wherever you are in the world.  
 A rich range  of course  materials  in our libraries  and online 
to support you with independent pre -reading a nd analysis, 
developing your skills as an active researcher.  
 Our libraries  will be open , including  our Student  Centre  and 
learning spaces alongside our huge range of electronic 
resources (e -resources) to support you in your studies.  
 Many opportunities to p ursue your interests outside your 
programme , including UCL volunteering and 
14  entrepreneurship programmes, and the clubs and societies 
run by your Students’ Union. ” 
 
39. In or around August 2020, UCL revised its position on teaching in Term 
One of the academic y ear 2020 -21, due to commence on 28 September 2020. 
It announced on its website:  
 
“Due to social distancing requirements, all your Term One core 
teaching will take place online, including lectures, tutorials, 
seminars and assessments. By ‘core teaching’ we mean everything 
you need  to learn  to complete  the module  successfully.  There  will be 
highly  interactive  sessions  in real time,  as well as engaging  learning 
activities designed so you can study at your own pace and in your 
own time zone.  We are also making  sure that dissertations  and major 
projects can be carried out online.  
 
…Campus will be open, as will UCL libraries, UCL Careers, the 
Student Centre and Students’ Union UCL spaces. The physical 
access you will have to these facilities and social spaces will  be 
severely  restricted  in Term  One,  but you will have  full online  access 
to our services.  
 
Your  safety  is our priority  and in Term  One,  opportunities  to join us 
on campus will be significantly reduced.  
 
…Physical access to study spaces, common rooms, libr aries and 
social spaces will also be severely restricted in Term One, but you 
will have full online access to our services. ” 
 
40. On 9 November 2020, the UCL website published “ An important message 
about  your UCL  Education  in Terms  Two and Three  2020 -21”. The message 
stated  that teaching  and assessment  in Terms  Two and Three  (11 January  to 
11 June 2021)  would  be similar  to Term  One,  in that “all core teaching  and 
assessment will be online (by core teaching, we mean everything you need 
to learn to complete the m odule successfully) ”. 
 
41. On 2 January  2021,  the UCL  website  published  a message  from  the Provost, 
Professor Michael Arthur, and incoming Provost Dr Michael Spence, with 
information  for new and returning  students  for Term  Two,  due to commence 
on 11 January  2021. The message  stated  that UCL  was moving  “all teaching 
and other face -to-face, in -person activities on -line from the start of term 
until the end of reading  week.  There  will be no in-person  teaching  on 
15  campus until Monday 22 February, at the earliest (exc ept for a small 
number of exempt subjects, see below). ” The message strongly advised 
students not to plan to come to campus until reading week (which 
commenced on 15 February 2021) at the earliest.  
 
42. On 29 January  2021,  the UCL  website  published  a further  message  from  the 
Provost, Dr Spence, which stated that all teaching and other face -to-face 
activities would remain online for the remainder of Term Two (until 26 
March 2021), except for a small number of exempt courses.  
 
43. On 8 February  2021,  the UCL  website  published  an announcement  from  the 
Vice Provost, Professor Anthony Smith, concerning “ COVID -mitigation 
measures for 2020 -21 exams and assessments ”. The announcement 
acknowledged  that “you have  not had access  to facilities  such as the library 
in the normal way” and stated that staff would mark students’ work taking 
into account  the challenges  they had faced,  giving  as an example,  “this might 
mean that you have drawn examples from a narrower range of reference 
sources than you would have done in a normal year  with full access to all 
library facilities. ” 
 
44. For the whole  of the academic  year 2020 -21, in line with the announcements 
referred to at paragraphs 39, 40, and 41 to 42 above:  
 
a. UCL did not provide the Claimants with in -person, campus -based 
tuition.  All core teaching  and assessment  were  provided  online  only 
(except for a small number of exempt courses); and  
 
b. While  the UCL  campus  was open, the Claimants’  physical  access  to 
UCL’s  facilities  was severely  restricted.  For example,  many  libraries 
were  completely  closed  from  January  to April  2021.  Insofar as the 
Claimants are presently able, the extent of the closures in respect of each of 
UCL’ s libraries is particularised in Appendix 3. When  open,  the libraries 
often operated on a restricted basis, for example by (a) offering  a 
“click  and collect”  service  only,  (b) restricting  the number of  
available  study spaces, and/or (c) restricting the num ber of hours  for 
16  which students could book study spaces. The Claimants reserve the right 
to plead further particulars of the restrictions on physical access to UCL’s 
facilities following disclosure.  
 
Academic  year  2021 -22 
 
45. In the academic  year 2021 -22, a material  proportion  of the teaching  at UCL, 
particularly large  group teaching , was provided online only. The Claimants 
reserve the right to plead further particulars of the extent of such online 
teaching following disclosure.  
 
Tuition  Fees during  Covid -19 
 
46. UCL charged and collected Tuition Fees in full throughout the Covid -19 
pandemic.  The Learning  Opportunities  Fund  did not cover  disruption  caused 
by Covid -19. UCL did not offer any Tuition Fee reduction or rebate to 
students to compensate them for the loss of in -person tuition and full, 
physical access to the facilities designed to support students’ learning.  
 
Breaches  of contract  
 
47. In performance  of the Contracts,  each Claimant  paid Tuition  Fees in the full 
amount charged by UCL (or, upon the Claimant undert aking liabilities to 
the Student  Loans  Company,  such Tuition  Fees were  paid on the Claimant’s 
behalf).  Insofar as the Claimants are presently able,  Appendix  2 specifies  
whether  each student  is/was  a UK/ EU student or an overseas student, and 
the total amou nt of Tuition Fees paid by or on behalf of each Claimant.  
 
48. UCL failed to provide in -person, campus -based tuition and/or physical 
access to facilities to support the Claimants’ learning on at least the 
following occasions:  
 
a. In the academic  year 2017 -18, UCL  failed  to provide  teaching  on 14 
teaching days (out of 105 teaching days – ‘teaching days’ excludes  
17  reading  week  and Term  Three,  during  which  no teaching  was 
scheduled).  
 
b. In the academic year 2019 -2020,  UCL  failed to  provide  teaching on 
20 teaching days (out of 105 teaching days – ‘teaching days’ 
excludes reading week and Term Three, during which no teaching 
was scheduled).  
 
c. In the academic  year 2021 -22, UCL  failed  to provide  teaching  on 13 
teaching days (out of 105 teaching days – ‘teaching days’ exclude s 
reading week and Term Three, during which no teaching was 
scheduled).  
 
d. In Term  Two of the academic  year 2019 -20, between  16 March  and 
27 March 2020, UCL failed to provide in -person teaching, and 
instead cancelled teaching or provided online teaching.  
 
e. In Term  Three  of the academic  year 2019 -20, between  27 April  and 
12 June 2020,  UCL  failed  to provide  in-person  teaching,  and instead 
provided online teaching.  
 
f. In Terms  Two and Three  of the academic  year 2019 -20, between  16 
March and 12 June 2020, UCL failed  to provide physical access to 
facilities  to support  students’  learning  (including,  but not limited  to, 
libraries  and laboratories);  they were  either  closed  or access  to them 
was severely restricted.  
 
g. For the entirety  of the academic  year 2020 -21, UCL  failed to provide 
in-person teaching; almost all teaching was online only.  
 
h. For the entirety  of the academic  year 2020 -21, UCL  failed  to provide 
physical access to its facilities to support students’ learning 
(including, but not limited to libraries and labora tories); they were 
either closed or access to them was severely restricted.  
18  i. In the academic year 2021 -22, UCL failed to provide in -person 
teaching, in that most large group teaching was  held online only.  
 
49. Insofar as the Claimants are presently able, the e xtent to which the failures 
identified at paragraph 48 above applied to each Claimant is particularised 
in Appendix 2.  
 
50. The failures identified in paragraph 48 above amounted to breaches of the 
Contracts as follows:  
 
a. In relation to Claimants who contracted with UCL on the Standard 
Terms  referred  to in paragraph  7 above  (namely,  undergraduate  and 
graduates commencing in 2015 -16, 2016 -17 and 2017 -18), UCL’s 
failures am ounted to a breach of clauses 7.3(1) and 7.9(1) of the 
Standard Terms;  
 
b. In relation to Claimants who contracted with UCL on the Standard 
terms referred to in paragraph 8 above (namely, graduates 
commencing in 2018 -19 and 2019 -20), UCL’s failures amounted to 
a breach of clauses 13 and 27 of the Standard Terms;  
 
c. In relation to Claimants who contracted with UCL on the Standard 
Terms referred to in paragraph 9 above (namely, undergraduates 
commencing  in 2018 -19 and 2019 -20), UCL’s  failures  amounted  to 
a breach of clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 of the Standard Terms;  
 
d. In relation to Claimants who contracted with UCL on the Standard 
Terms referred to in paragraph 10 above (namely, undergraduates 
commencing  in 2020 -21 and 2021 -22), UCL’s  failures amounted to a 
breach of clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 of the Standard Terms;  
 
e. In relation to Claimants who contracted with UCL on the Standard 
Terms referred to in paragraph 11 above (namely, graduates 
commencing  in 2020 -21 and 2021 -22), UCL’s  failures  amou nted to a 
breach of clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 of the Standard Terms;  
19   
f. Alternatively,  in relation  to all Claimants,  UCL’s  failures  amounted 
to a breach of the implied term to provide in -person, campus -based 
tuition and physical access to facilities to support  the Claimants’ 
learning.  
 
Causation  and Loss 
 
51. By reason  of the aforesaid  breaches  of contract,  each Claimant  has suffered 
loss and damage, in that the tuition and related services for which the 
Claimants contracted have not been provided, alternatively th ey have been 
only partially  provided,  or have  been  provided  in a materially  different  form 
to that which was promised.  
 
52. The Claimants seek damages, in an amount to be quantified, representing 
the difference  between  (a) the market  value  of the services  prom ised and (b) 
the market value of the services provided.  In particular:  
 
a. Damages  in respect  of UCL’s  failures  pleaded  in paragraphs  48.a, 
48.b and 48.c above (in br ief, cancellation of teaching) should be  
calculated in accordance with the first formula in Appendix 4. 
 
b. Damages in respect of UCL’s failures pleaded in paragraphs 48.d, 
48.e, 48.g and 48.i above (in brief, teaching moved online) should be  
calculated  in accordance  with the second  formula  in Appendix  4. 
 
c. Damages  in respect  of UCL’s  failures  pleaded  in paragraphs  48.f and 
48.h above  (in brief,  restricted  access  to UCL’s  facilities)  should  be 
calculated in accordance with the third formula in Appendix 4. 
 
53. Alternatively,  the Claimants  seek an inquiry  as to damages.
