4. Mr Abaris registered on the course on 24 September 2018 . The end date of his registration 
was 1 July 2024 . 
5. His UCL student number was 18006790 . The unique UCL reference number used in these 
proceedings is 60005 . 
6. At all material times, Mr Abaris  was resident in the United Kingdom.  
7. At all material times, Mr Abaris’  fee-paying status was Home .  
The Abaris  Contract  
8. Pursuant to the Abaris  Contract, Mr Abaris agreed to pay tuition fees and UCL agreed to

 Factual matrix  
12. Paragraphs 13 -14 of the GPOC are repeated.  
13. Mr Ab aris relies on the full content of the UCL Undergraduate Prospectus es for the 
academic year s 2018 -19 and 2019 -20 as material relevant to the construction of the Abaris  
Contract, being the Prospectus relevant to the academic year of the commencement of his 
studies  and the Prospectus for the subsequent academic year (which was published some 
18 months ahead).  Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Mr Abaris relies in 
particular on the following matters:  
a. Both Prospectuses contained photographs o f UCL’s campus and of students 
receiving tuition in person and enjoying physical access to UCL’s facilities, such as 
libraries.  
b. Both  Prospectus es emphasised the importance to the student experience of UCL ’s 
location in London and its on -site or nearby fac ilities .  For example , in the 2018 -19 
Prospectus : “We’re based in the heart of London – giving you outstanding 
academic, professional and social benefits ”; “UCL ’s Bloomsbury campus has 
various resources to make your studies enjoyable and effective as well as enabling 
you to make the most of your free time. All you need to fulfil your potential is here, 
right at the heart of one of the world ’s great capital cities ”; “As well as being open 
to the public, UCL ’s diverse museums and collections (see list on the right) are 
often used as teaching resources. ”; “At UCL, you don ’t just learn it, you can live 
it[.] The resources for learning you can enjoy in London are many and varied. ” 
c. Both Prospectuses suggested that teaching would take place in person. For 
example:  
i. They contained images of students studying and being taught on campus 
and of on -site teaching facilities. The sections on “ Medicine ” (in the 2018 -
19 Prospectus) and “Medicine and Allied Subjects ” (in the 2019 -20 
Prospectus)  displayed images of students bei ng taught in labs and 
classrooms.  
ii. They contained sections  on open days . The 2018 -19 Prospectus stated these 
were “ A great opportunity to explore the university and our world -class 
facilities ”. The 2019 -20 Prospectus stated  “Discover UCL for yourself – 
Docusign Envelope ID: D98405F7-BAAC-4075-AF3F-6F9EFC09A860
 
4 
 There’s always something exciting going on at UCL, and our central 
London location makes finding us easy .” 
iii. The 2019 -20 Prospectus contained a section entitled “ Life outside the 
lecture theatre ”.  
d. The 2018 -19 Prospectus stated in particular that “Medical st udents can take 
advantage of UCL ’s various clinical and research institutions, including the 
Institutes of Child Health, Neurology, Ophthalmology and the Ear Institute.  The 
new Francis Crick Institute opened in 2016. ” 
e. Both  Prospectus es advertised the extensive library resources available to students.  
For example: “ Having been open for nearly 200 years we’ve acquired millions of 
books and tens of thousands of journals, and these can be found across our 18 
specialist libraries… A number of our libraries are open throughout the night.”  
f. Both  Prospectus es stated that UCL guaranteed residential accommodation to 
undergraduate students in their first year of study, subject to certain conditions. The 
centrality within London or convenience of su ch accommodation for “the 
Bloomsbury campus ” was referred to.  
14. Mr Abaris also relies as material relevant to the construction of the Abaris Contract on the 
full content of UCL’s webpage providing details on the BSc and MBBS in Medicine for 
prospective students ( https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective -
students/undergraduate/degrees/medicine -mbbs -bsc). Without prejudice to the generality 
of the foregoing, Mr Abari s relies in particular on the matters set out in the sub -paragraphs 
which follow, which were taken from an archived copy of the webpage dated 21 February 
2018.1 It is to be inferred, subject to disclosure by UCL of the relevant webpage as at 14 
February 20 18, that the same details were on the webpage at the time of contracting:  
a. The banner at the top of the webpage showed a photograph of two students studying 
in-person ;  
b. In the introductory section, the webpage stated: “ You will have clinical contact 
throug hout with patients and doctors ”;

 c. In the section headed “ Degree benefits ”, the webpage stated: “ Our location in 
central London provides access to exciting clinical attachments in a range of 
settings ”;  
d. In the section headed “ Your learning ”, the webpage sta ted: “ a variety of teaching 
and learning methods are used throughout the programme. These include: small 
group activities, lectures, self -paced and computer -assisted learning, practical 
work, patient and community -based activities, and private study. Anato my and 
imaging are taught through a combination of dissection, prosection and computer 
simulation. You will also learn from a range of healthcare professionals and 
patients during placements ”.  
e. The webpage included a quote from a fifth year student stating: “… As I've reached 
my clinical years, I've learnt to appreciate the advantage we have by rotating 
around some of the best hospitals in the country ”. 
15. Mr Abaris also relies as material relevant to the construction of the Abaris Contract on the 
full c ontent of the Medical School’s webpage (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical -sciences ). 
Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Mr Abaris relies in particular on the 
matters set out in the sub -paragraphs which follow, which were taken from archived cop ies 
of the relevant webpage s from January  2018.  It is to be inferred, subject to disclosure by 
UCL of the relevant webpage as at 14 February 2018, that the same details were on the 
webpage at the time  of contracting : 
a. The “Study” page2 contained a section headed  “Why UCL? ” with a photograph of 
UCL’s Main Quad. Two of the reasons given were that UCL is “ Situated in the 
heart of cosmopolitan London ” and “A vibrant, dynamic and friendly place in which 
to be a student ”. The answers to “ Why UCL Medical School? ” included “ Clinical 
teaching in some of London’s world famous hospitals ” and “ Opportunity to practise 
your clinical skills in our fully equipped clinical skills centres ”.  
b. The “MBBS Programme Informati on” page3 stated “ Core medical education is 
provided at UCL and three central clinical campuses. The Bloomsbury campus has 
as its main clinical facilities University College Hospital (UCH). The sixteen -storey

 UCH provides excellent healthcare facilities, a s well as being a centre of 
international importance for clinical teaching and research. The Royal Free 
campus in Hampstead is the site of the Royal Free Hospital. The Whittington 
campus in Archway is the site of the newly refurbished Whittington Hospital,  set to 
become one of the country’s first Integrated Care Organisations. Clinical teaching 
also takes place in many other prestigious Foundation Trusts, Associated 
University Hospitals, District General Hospitals, and in a range of general practice 
and com munity settings .” 
16. In the premises and on the true construction of the Tuition Clause and Facilities Clause in 
the Abaris Contract, UCL owed a contractual duty to Mr Abaris to provide  him with (i) in -
person, campus -based tuition and (ii) physical access to facilities to support  his learning. 
Without prejudice to the foregoing, UCL and Mr Abaris intended and expected those terms 
to have such a meaning.  
17. Alternatively, it was an implied term of the Abaris  Contract that UCL would provide Mr 
Abaris with in -perso n, campus -based tuition and physical access to facilities to support Mr 
Abari s’ learning. Such a term was implied on grounds that it was obvious.  
18. The Abaris Contract did not contain terms specifying the number of hours of tuition which 
would be provided to  Mr Abaris . Such information, provided by UCL after the Abaris  
Contract was entered into, is pleaded below (to the extent possible) for the purposes of 
identifying the extent of UCL’s breaches and quantifying Mr Abaris’  claim .
