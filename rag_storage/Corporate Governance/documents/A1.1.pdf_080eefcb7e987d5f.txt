Seek s directions, declarations and other relief as set out in the enclosed witness statement and draft order.  
 
As the matter is not straightforward and occurs in the context of long running proceedings in which Foxton J 
is the designated judge , the Applicant seeks  a directions hearing  (time estimate 1hr 30m), to be listed at a 
time after evidence on the application has been exchanged.  
 
Subject to the directions made at the directions hearing, it is anticipated that  a 2 day  substantive hearing is 
required for the purposes of determination of certain potentially dispositive aspects of the relief  sought, as  
set out in the  enclosed  draft order.  A second phase may or may not prove necessary depending on the 
outcome of that hearing.
