• select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;

--- Table 12 ---

• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

--- Table 13 ---

• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

--- Table 14 ---

• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.

--- Table 15 ---

--- Table 16 ---

• give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2020 and of its profit for the year then ended; • have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and • have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

--- Table 17 ---

• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or • the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

--- Table 18 ---

--- Table 19 ---

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

--- Table 20 ---

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.

--- Table 21 ---

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.

--- Table 22 ---

• Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

--- Table 23 ---

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

--- Table 24 ---

• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the company to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the company audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: • the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or • the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Other information The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. Page 7 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of United Wholesale Grocers Limited We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities [set out on page 6 ], the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK), we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. • Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the company to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the company audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Page 8 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of United Wholesale Grocers Limited We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Page 12 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 1 Statutory information The company is a private company limited by share capital, incorporated in Scotland. The address of its registered office is: 246 Flemington Street Springburn Glasgow G21 4BY These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board on 21 December 2021 . 2 Accounting policies Statement of compliance These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland'. Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except that as disclosed in the accounting policies certain items are shown at fair value. Exemption has been taken from preparing a cash flow statement on the grounds that the parent company includes the subsidiary in its published financial statements. Going concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Company financial statements. Revenue recognition Turnover comprises revenue recognised when goods are received by the customers and risks and rewards of ownership passed to them. Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services net of Value Added Tax and trade discounts. Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result. Tax The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income. Page 13 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the financial statements. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference. Tangible assets Tangible fixed assets under the cost model, other than investment properties, are stated in the statement of financial position at historical cost, except use of GAAP value of land and buildings on 1 January 2014 as deemed cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation. Depreciation Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Asset class Depreciation method and rate Freehold buildings 50 years Plant, fixtures and fittings 5 to 7 years Motor Vehicles 5 years Freehold Land Freehold land is not depreciated. Investment property Investment property is carried at fair value, derived from the current market prices for comparable real estate determined annually by the directors. The fair value is determined by the directors based on the current estimated market rent value using observable market prices, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Trade debtors Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Page 14 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Trade creditors Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the company has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of their fair value at inception of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis. Dividends Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the reporting period in which the dividends are declared. Defined contribution pension obligation The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate. Page 15 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 Financial instruments Classification Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Recognition and measurement Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade payables or receivables, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration, expected to be paid or received. However if the arrangement of a short-term instrument constitute a financing transaction, like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate or in case of an out-right short-term loan not at a market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially at the present value of the future cash flow discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument and subsequently at a amortised cost. Financial asset that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Income. For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is current effective interest rate determined under the contract. For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate, which is an approximation of the amount that the Company would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the balance sheet date. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously Page 16 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. In preparing these financial statements, the directors have made the following judgements: Tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties, are depreciated over their useful lives taking into account residual values, where appropriate. The actual lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors. In re-assessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account. Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the asset and projected disposal values. Investment properties are valued each year. The directors consider market conditions and the value of similar property in deciding a fair value. Bad debts are provided for where objective evidence of the need for a provision exists. Stocks are assessed for evidence of obsolescence and a provision is made against any inventory unlikely to be sold. Cost of Sales Cost of sales represents all costs incurred, net of supplier rebates (see below), up to the point of sale including the operating expenses of the trading outlets. 3 Revenue The analysis of the company's revenue for the year from continuing operations is as follows: 2020 £ 2019 £ Sale of goods 215,847,481 167,438,677 Rental income from investment property 77,110 111,717 Other revenue 28,780 21,168 215,953,371 167,571,562 The analysis of the company's turnover for the year by market is as follows: 2020 £ 2019 £ UK 215,087,141 167,571,562 Europe 694,413 - Rest of world 171,817 - 215,953,371 167,571,562 Page 17 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 4 Other operating income The analysis of the company's other operating income for the year is as follows: 2020 £ 2019 £ Job retention scheme grant 30,290 - 5 Operating profit Arrived at after charging/(crediting) 2020 £ 2019 £ Depreciation expense 250,488 253,993 Operating lease expense - plant and machinery 138,055 132,823 6 Other interest receivable and similar income 2020 £ 2019 £ Interest income on bank deposits 20,107 27,281 Other finance income 48,872 91,041 68,979 118,322 7 Interest payable and similar expenses 2020 £ 2019 £ Hire purchase interest 1,620 1,620 Page 18 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 8 Staff costs The aggregate payroll costs (including directors' remuneration) were as follows: 2020 £ 2019 £ Wages and salaries 3,929,847 3,740,953 Social security costs 321,564 295,563 Pension costs, defined contribution scheme 66,416 60,268 4,317,827 4,096,784 The average number of persons employed by the company (including directors) during the year, analysed by category was as follows: 2020 No. 2019 No. Administration and support 62 52 Sales, marketing and distribution 143 138 205 190 9 Directors' remuneration The directors' remuneration for the year was as follows: 2020 £ 2019 £ Remuneration 87,750 88,250 10 Auditors' remuneration 2020 £ 2019 £ Audit of the financial statements 19,000 16,500 Other fees to auditors Taxation compliance services 4,000 2,500 All other assurance services 11,000 3,000 15,000 5,500 Page 19 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 11 Taxation Tax charged/(credited) in the income statement 2020 £ 2019 £ Current taxation UK corporation tax 2,020,708 606,247 UK corporation tax adjustment to prior periods ( 52,509 ) ( 10,589 ) 1,968,199 595,658 Deferred taxation Arising from write-down or reversal of write-down of deferred tax asset ( 33,220 ) 5,351 Tax expense in the income statement 1,934,979 601,009 The tax on profit before tax for the year is the same as the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK (2019 - the same as the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK) of 19 % (2019 - 19 % ).

Excise duty In 2013 the company purchased certain goods from a supplier at a market price inclusive of excise duty. HM Revenue and Customs allege that the UK duty on the goods was not paid by the defaulting/missing trader or supplier, therefore any person involved in the holding of the excise goods is jointly and severally liable to pay the duty. Hence HM Revenue & Customs has raised an assessment for unpaid duty amounting to £713,992. The company lodged an appeal against the assessment awaiting hearing.
