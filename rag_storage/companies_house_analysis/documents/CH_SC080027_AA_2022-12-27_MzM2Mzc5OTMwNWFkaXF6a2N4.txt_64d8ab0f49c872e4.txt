Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the original financial statements were authorised for issue. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. Other information The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Page 8 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of United Wholesale Grocers Limited In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: • the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and • the Strategic Report and Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. Matters on which we are required to report by exception In the light of our knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report. We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: • adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or • the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or • certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities [set out on page 7 ], the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Page 9 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of United Wholesale Grocers Limited Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. In identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non compliance with laws and regulations we considered the nature of the company and the industry and the company's control environment. We identified specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial statements or the operation of the company such as the Companies Act 2006, taxation legislation, employment laws and health and safety regulations.We assessed the extent of compliance with laws and regulations identified through making inquiries of management and discussing their policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations; inspecting correspondence, if any, with relevant licensing or regulatory authorities. We evaluated the directors and management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements, including the risk of management bias and override of controls. Our audit procedures to respond to the risks identified included but not limited to the following: • Performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships and testing appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments. • Assessing whether judgements and assumptions made in determining accounting estimates were indicative of potential bias; and evaluating business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business. • Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. • Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the company to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the company audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks were communicated to all engagement team member, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of irregularities including fraud rests with management. As with any audit, there remained a risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal controls.

This description forms part of our auditor's report. Use of the audit report This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Page 14 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2021 1 Statutory information The company is a private company limited by share capital, incorporated in Scotland. The address of its registered office is: 246 Flemington Street Springburn Glasgow G21 4BY These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board on 15 December 2022 . 2 Accounting policies Statement of compliance These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006'. Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except that as disclosed in the accounting policies certain items are shown at fair value. Exemption has been taken from preparing a cash flow statement on the grounds that the parent company includes the subsidiary in its published financial statements. Going concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Company financial statements. Revenue recognition Turnover comprises revenue recognised when goods are received by the customers and risks and rewards of ownership passed to them. Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services net of Value Added Tax and trade discounts. Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result. Tax The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income. Page 15 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2021 Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the financial statements. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference. Tangible assets Tangible fixed assets under the cost model, other than investment properties, are stated in the statement of financial position at historical cost, except use of GAAP value of land and buildings on 1 January 2014 as deemed cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation. Depreciation Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Asset class Depreciation method and rate Freehold buildings 50 years Plant, fixtures and fittings 5 to 7 years Motor Vehicles 5 years Freehold Land Freehold land is not depreciated. Investment property Investment property is carried at fair value, derived from the current market prices for comparable real estate determined annually by the directors. The fair value is determined by the directors based on the current estimated market rent value using observable market prices, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Investments Investments in equity shares which are publicly traded or where the fair value can be measured reliably are initially measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Investments in equity shares which are not publicly traded and where fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less impairment. Interest income on debt securities, where applicable, is recognised in income using the effective interest method. Dividends on equity securities are recognised in income when receivable. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Page 16 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2021 Trade debtors Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Costs of purchased stock are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. A provision is made for obsolete and slow moving items. At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Trade creditors Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the company has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of their fair value at inception of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Page 17 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2021 Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis. Dividends Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the reporting period in which the dividends are declared. Defined contribution pension obligation The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate. Financial instruments Classification Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Recognition and measurement Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade payables or receivables, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration, expected to be paid or received. However if the arrangement of a short-term instrument constitute a financing transaction, like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate or in case of an out-right short-term loan not at a market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially at the present value of the future cash flow discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument and subsequently at a amortised cost. Financial asset that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Income. For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is current effective interest rate determined under the contract. For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate, which is an approximation of the amount that the Company would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the balance sheet date. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously Page 18 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2021 Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. In preparing these financial statements, the directors have made the following judgements: Tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties, are depreciated over their useful lives taking into account residual values, where appropriate. The actual lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors. In re-assessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account. Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the asset and projected disposal values. Investment properties are valued each year. The directors consider market conditions and the value of similar property in deciding a fair value. Bad debts are provided for where objective evidence of the need for a provision exists. Stocks are assessed for evidence of obsolescence and a provision is made against any inventory unlikely to be sold.

Excise duty In 2013 the company purchased certain goods from a supplier at a market price inclusive of excise duty. HM Revenue and Customs allege that the UK duty on the goods was not paid by the defaulting/missing trader or supplier, therefore any person involved in the holding of the excise goods is jointly and severally liable to pay the duty. Hence HM Revenue & Customs has raised an assessment for unpaid duty amounting to £713,992. The company lodged an appeal against the assessment awaiting hearing. Based on legal advice management believes that the defence against the assessment will be successful. Although liability is not admitted but because of uncertainty, a full provision has been made.
