Review of the Business The company's performance in 2023 reflects solid growth and prudent financial management, with key highlights across both financial and non-financial metrics. Financial Performance: Revenue Growth: The company achieved a 3.81% increase in turnover, reaching \u00a3226.3 million, up from \u00a3218 million in 2022. This steady growth is attributed to effective product availability management, particularly through strategic stockpiling when shortages were anticipated, positively impacting sales performance. Profitability: Gross profit rose to \u00a318.8 million, an increase of \u00a31.9 million from the previous year, driven by improved purchasing discounts and a well-calibrated pricing and promotional strategy. Operating profit saw an even more pronounced rise, growing by 27.2% to \u00a36.1 million from \u00a34.8 million. This impressive growth is largely due to enhanced gross margins and disciplined cost management, keeping operating expenses below inflation levels. Cash Reserves: The company\u2019s cash generation has been robust, with cash and cash equivalents increasing to \u00a320.7 million from \u00a319.1 million in 2022. This healthy liquidity positions the company strongly, providing financial flexibility and headroom for future investments and mitigating external economic uncertainties.The company's turnover increased by 3.81% to \u00a3226.3 million from \u00a3218 million in 2022. We have continued to improve and manage availability of products during this period and where shortage was expected we carried higher level of stock, which resulted in the favourable impact on sales. Non-Financial Performance The company closely monitors key non-financial indicators such as customer satisfaction, staff turnover, and stakeholder relationships. These metrics are vital in maintaining a positive company culture, strong customer loyalty, and solid relationships with suppliers and other stakeholders. Regular feedback is gathered to continuously improve these areas. Principal Risks and Uncertainties The Board has implemented internal controls to facilitate the identification, assessment and management of risk, as a reasonable assurance against adverse implications. The principal risks determined by the Board, corresponding controls and mitigation actions are set out below and is not in particular order of priority. This represents the company's current profile and is not intended to be an exhaustive list of risks and uncertainties that may arise. Regulatory Compliance: The business operates in a highly regulated environment, covering areas such as health and safety, employment law, and data protection. The board is vigilant about regulatory changes, regularly updating policies and ensuring relevant employee training to maintain compliance. Failure to do so could harm profitability and reputation.

The board is vigilant about regulatory changes, regularly updating policies and ensuring relevant employee training to maintain compliance. Failure to do so could harm profitability and reputation. Competition: The wholesale industry remains intensely competitive, with pressure from both national retailers and regional independent wholesalers. The company competes effectively through a combination of competitive pricing, strong value propositions, and attractive promotions, ensuring it remains responsive to market shifts. Post-Brexit Effects: The company capitalized on Brexit by strategically holding higher stock levels, which bolstered sales. However, this benefit is unlikely to recur, and future profit margins may face pressure as the market adjusts to new conditions. Interest Rate Fluctuations : The company has benefited from the current high interest rates, but a potential reduction, as predicted, could impact profitability. Proactive financial planning will be necessary to mitigate this risk. Supplier Relationships and Credit Risk : Maintaining strong supplier relationships is critical to ensuring product availability. Any disruption in supply or reduction in supplier credit could adversely affect operations. The company mitigates this by closely managing supplier performance and maintaining diverse sourcing channels. ...CONTINUED Page 1 Page 2 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Strategic Report (continued) For The Year Ended 31 December 2023 Principal Risks and Uncertainties - continued Mitigation Strategies: Credit Risk Management: The company conducts stringent credit checks on new customers and employs robust credit control procedures. Additionally, it secures guarantees or undertakings from customers to safeguard against defaults. Operational Resilience: IT systems are essential for business continuity, and the company has invested in comprehensive backup procedures, network security, and independent cybersecurity expertise. This mitigates risks related to system failures and cyber threats. Health and Safety: The company prioritizes workplace safety, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards to avoid incidents that could result in financial or reputational damage. Policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and enforced across the business. Future Developments The company is well-positioned for future growth, with the directors intending to build on the strategies that have driven consistent performance. While inflationary pressures and broader economic uncertainties remain, the company\u2019s strong cash reserves provide a solid foundation for investment in new sales outlets and other growth opportunities. The management team is aware of the challenges ahead, including competitive pressures and the normalization of post-COVID market dynamics, but remains confident in the resilience of the business model. Strategic investments and continued focus on operational efficiency will be crucial in driving sustainable growth. While we remain cautious about the current economic climate, we hope to demonstrate the strength of our business model with the continued support of our employees a successful relationship with our suppliers and customers.

Statement of Directors' Responsibilities The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors' Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland', and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing the financial statements the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS102, have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business. The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Statement of Disclosure of Information to Auditors In the case of each director in office at the date the Directors' Report is approved: so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company's auditors are unaware; and they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of",

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 102 \"The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland\". In our opinion the financial statements: give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of its profit/(loss) for the year then ended; have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Conclusions Relating to Going Concern In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below: Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. In identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non- compliance with laws and regulations we considered the nature of the company and the industry and the company's control environment. We identified specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial statements or the operation of the company such as the Companies Act 2006, taxation legislation, employment laws and health and safety regulations. We assessed the extent of compliance with laws and regulations identified through making inquiries of management and discussing their policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations, inspecting correspondence, if any, with relevant licensing or regulatory authorities. We evaluated the directors and management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements, including the risk of management bias and override of controls. Our audit procedures to respond to the risks identified included but not limited to the following: Performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships and testing appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments. Assessing whether judgements and assumptions made in determining accounting estimates were indicative of potential bias; and evaluating business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business. Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the company to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the company audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks were communicated to all engagement team member and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of irregularities including fraud rests with management. As with any audit, there remained a risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal controls. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

General Information United Wholesale Grocers Limited is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in Scotland, registered number SC080027 . The registered office is 246 Flemington Street, Glasgow, G21 4BY. 2. Statement of Compliance The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 \"The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland\" and the Companies Act 2006. 3. Accounting Policies 3.1. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. 3.2. Financial Reporting Standard 102 - Reduced Disclosure Exemptions The company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions in preparing these financial statements, as permitted by FRS 102 \"The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland\": the requirements of Section 7 Statement of Cash Flows and Section 3 Financial Statement Presentation paragraph 3.17 (d). 3.3. Going Concern Disclosure The directors have not identified any material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Company financial statements. 3.4. Significant judgements and estimations The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. In preparing these financial statements, the directors have made the following judgements: Tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties, are depreciated over their useful lives taking into account residual values, where appropriate. The actual lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors. In re-assessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account. Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the asset and projected disposal values. Investment properties are valued each year. The directors consider market conditions and the value of similar property in deciding a fair value. Bad debts are provided for where objective evidence of the need for a provision exists. Stocks are assessed for evidence of obsolescence and a provision is made against any inventory unlikely to be sold. Page 15",

Page 15 Page 16 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) For The Year Ended 31 December 2023 3.5. Turnover Turnover comprises revenue recognised when goods are received by the customers and risks and rewards of ownership passed to them. Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services net of Value Added Tax and trade discounts. 3.6. Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation Tangible fixed assets under the cost model, other than investment properties, are stated in the statement of financial position at historical cost, except use of GAAP value of land and buildings on 1 January 2014 as deemed cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the fixed assets, less their estimated residual value, over their expected useful lives on the following bases: Freehold 50 years Plant & Machinery 5 to 7 years Motor Vehicles 5 years 3.7. Investment Properties All investment properties are carried at fair value determined annually and derived from the current market rents and investment property yields for comparable real estate, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. No depreciation is provided for. Changes in fair value are recognised in the profit and loss account. 3.8. Investments Investments in quoted and unquoted shares are initially stated at cost and subsequently at a fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. 3.9. Leasing and Hire Purchase Contracts Assets obtained under finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Assets acquired under hire purchase contracts are depreciated over their useful lives. Finance leases are those where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership are assumed by the company. Obligations under such agreements are included in the creditors net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. The finance element of the rental payment is charged to the profit and loss account so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligation outstanding in each period. Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged to profit and loss account as incurred. 3.10. Stocks and Work in Progress Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Costs of purchased stock are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. A provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving items. At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Page 16 Page 17 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) For The Year Ended 31 December 2023 3.11. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. 3.12. Financial Instruments Classification Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Recognition and measurement Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade payables or receivables, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration, expected to be paid or received. However if the arrangement of a short-term instrument constitute a financing transaction, like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate or in case of an out-right short-term loan not at a market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially at the present value of the future cash flow discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument and subsequently at a amortised cost. Financial asset that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Income. For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is current effective interest rate determined under the contract. For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate, which is an approximation of the amount that the Company would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the balance sheet date. Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 3.13. Foreign Currencies Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating profit.

Page 17 Page 18 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) For The Year Ended 31 December 2023 3.14. Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax is recognised on timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable timing differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible timing differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are presented within provisions for liabilities and deferred tax assets within debtors. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when they related to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. 3.15. Provisions and Contingencies Provisions Provisions are recognised when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised. Contingent liabilities arise as a result of past events when (i) it is not probable that there will be an outflow of resources or that the amount cannot be reliably measured at the reporting date or (ii) when the existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events not wholly within the company\u2019s control. Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the financial statements unless the probability of an outflow of resources is remote. Contingent assets are not recognised. Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial statements when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Page 18 Page 19 United Wholesale",

HM Revenue and Customs allege that the UK duty on the goods was not paid by the defaulting/missing trader or supplier, therefore any person involved in the holding of the excise goods is jointly and severally liable to pay the duty. Hence HM Revenue & Customs has raised an assessment for unpaid duty amounting to \u00a3713,992. The company lodged an appeal against the assessment awaiting hearing. Based on legal advice management believes that the defence against the assessment will be successful. Although liability is not admitted but because of uncertainty, a full provision has been made. 22. Share Capital",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. In identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non compliance with laws and regulations we considered the nature of the company and the industry and the company's control environment. We identified specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial statements or the operation of the company such as the Companies Act 2006, taxation legislation, employment laws and health and safety regulations.We assessed the extent of compliance with laws and regulations identified through making inquiries of management and discussing their policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations; inspecting correspondence, if any, with relevant licensing or regulatory authorities. We evaluated the directors and management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements, including the risk of management bias and override of controls. Our audit procedures to respond to the risks identified included but not limited to the following: \u2022 Performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships and testing appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments. \u2022 Assessing whether judgements and assumptions made in determining accounting estimates were indicative of potential bias; and evaluating business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business. \u2022 Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. \u2022 Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \u2022 Obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the company to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the company audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks were communicated to all engagement team member, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference. Tangible assets Tangible fixed assets under the cost model, other than investment properties, are stated in the statement of financial position at historical cost, except use of GAAP value of land and buildings on 1 January 2014 as deemed cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation. Depreciation Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Asset class Depreciation method and rate Freehold buildings 50 years Plant, fixtures and fittings 5 to 7 years Motor Vehicles 5 years Freehold Land Freehold land is not depreciated. Investment property Investment property is carried at fair value, derived from the current market prices for comparable real estate determined annually by the directors. The fair value is determined by the directors based on the current estimated market rent value using observable market prices, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Trade debtors Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Page 16 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Costs of purchased stock are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. A provision is made for obsolete and slow moving items. At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Trade creditors Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer",

Trade creditors Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the company has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis. Dividends Dividend distribution to the company\u2019s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the reporting period in which the dividends are declared. Defined contribution pension obligation The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate. Page 17 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 Financial instruments Classification Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Recognition and measurement Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade payables or receivables, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration, expected to be paid or received. However if the arrangement of a short-term instrument constitute a financing transaction, like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate or in case of an out-right short-term loan not at a market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially at the present value of the future cash flow discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument and subsequently at a amortised cost. Financial asset that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found,",

      "text": "an out-right short-term loan not at a market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially at the present value of the future cash flow discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument and subsequently at a amortised cost. Financial asset that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Income. For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is current effective interest rate determined under the contract. For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate, which is an approximation of the amount that the Company would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the balance sheet date. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously Page 18 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. In preparing these financial statements, the directors have made the following judgements: Tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties, are depreciated over their useful lives taking into account residual values, where appropriate. The actual lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors. In re-assessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account. Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the asset and projected disposal values. Investment properties are valued each year. The directors consider market conditions and the value of similar property in deciding a fair value. Bad debts are provided for where objective evidence of the need for a provision exists. Stocks are assessed for evidence of obsolescence and a provision is made against any inventory unlikely to be sold.

Excise duty In 2013 the company purchased certain goods from a supplier at a market price inclusive of excise duty. HM Revenue and Customs allege that the UK duty on the goods was not paid by the defaulting/missing trader or supplier, therefore any person involved in the holding of the excise goods is jointly and severally liable to pay the duty. Hence HM Revenue & Customs has raised an assessment for unpaid duty amounting to \u00a3713,992. The company lodged an appeal against the assessment awaiting hearing. Based on legal advice management believes that the defence against the assessment will be successful. Although liability is not admitted but because of uncertainty, a full provision has been made. 18 Pension and other schemes Defined contribution pension scheme The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme.

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: \u2022 select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently; \u2022 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; \u2022 state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and \u2022 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business. The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: \u2022 the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and \u2022 the Strategic Report and Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. Matters on which we are required to report by exception In the light of our knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. In identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non compliance with laws and regulations we considered the nature of the company and the industry and the company's control environment. We identified specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial statements or the operation of the company such as the Companies Act 2006, taxation legislation, employment laws and health and safety regulations.We assessed the extent of compliance with laws and regulations identified through making inquiries of management and discussing their policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations; inspecting correspondence, if any, with relevant licensing or regulatory authorities. We evaluated the directors and management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements, including the risk of management bias and override of controls. Our audit procedures to respond to the risks identified included but not limited to the following: \u2022 Performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships and testing appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments. \u2022 Assessing whether judgements and assumptions made in determining accounting estimates were indicative of potential bias; and evaluating business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business. \u2022 Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. \u2022 Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \u2022 Obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the company to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the company audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks were communicated to all engagement team member, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of irregularities including fraud rests with management. As with any audit, there remained a risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal controls.

The address of its registered office is: 246 Flemington Street Springburn Glasgow G21 4BY These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board on 15 December 2022 . 2 Accounting policies Statement of compliance These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006'. Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except that as disclosed in the accounting policies certain items are shown at fair value. Exemption has been taken from preparing a cash flow statement on the grounds that the parent company includes the subsidiary in its published financial statements. Going concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of this report. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Company financial statements. Revenue recognition Turnover comprises revenue recognised when goods are received by the customers and risks and rewards of ownership passed to them. Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services net of Value Added Tax and trade discounts. Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result. Tax The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income. Page 15 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2021 Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the financial statements. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference. Tangible assets Tangible fixed assets under the cost model, other than investment properties, are stated in the statement of financial position at historical cost, except use of GAAP value of land and buildings on 1 January 2014 as deemed cost,",

Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference. Tangible assets Tangible fixed assets under the cost model, other than investment properties, are stated in the statement of financial position at historical cost, except use of GAAP value of land and buildings on 1 January 2014 as deemed cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation. Depreciation Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Asset class Depreciation method and rate Freehold buildings 50 years Plant, fixtures and fittings 5 to 7 years Motor Vehicles 5 years Freehold Land Freehold land is not depreciated. Investment property Investment property is carried at fair value, derived from the current market prices for comparable real estate determined annually by the directors. The fair value is determined by the directors based on the current estimated market rent value using observable market prices, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Investments Investments in equity shares which are publicly traded or where the fair value can be measured reliably are initially measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Investments in equity shares which are not publicly traded and where fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less impairment. Interest income on debt securities, where applicable, is recognised in income using the effective interest method. Dividends on equity securities are recognised in income when receivable. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Page 16 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2021 Trade debtors Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Costs of purchased stock are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. A provision is made for obsolete and slow moving items. At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Trade creditors Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

Trade creditors Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the company has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of their fair value at inception of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Page 17 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2021 Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis. Dividends Dividend distribution to the company\u2019s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the reporting period in which the dividends are declared. Defined contribution pension obligation The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate. Financial instruments Classification Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Recognition and measurement Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade payables or receivables, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration, expected to be paid or received.

Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade payables or receivables, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration, expected to be paid or received. However if the arrangement of a short-term instrument constitute a financing transaction, like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate or in case of an out-right short-term loan not at a market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially at the present value of the future cash flow discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument and subsequently at a amortised cost. Financial asset that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Income. For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is current effective interest rate determined under the contract. For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate, which is an approximation of the amount that the Company would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the balance sheet date. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously Page 18 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2021 Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. In preparing these financial statements, the directors have made the following judgements: Tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties, are depreciated over their useful lives taking into account residual values, where appropriate. The actual lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors. In re-assessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account. Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the asset and projected disposal values. Investment properties are valued each year. The directors consider market conditions and the value of similar property in deciding a fair value. Bad debts are provided for where objective evidence of the need for a provision exists. Stocks are assessed for evidence of obsolescence",

Excise duty In 2013 the company purchased certain goods from a supplier at a market price inclusive of excise duty. HM Revenue and Customs allege that the UK duty on the goods was not paid by the defaulting/missing trader or supplier, therefore any person involved in the holding of the excise goods is jointly and severally liable to pay the duty. Hence HM Revenue & Customs has raised an assessment for unpaid duty amounting to \u00a3713,992. The company lodged an appeal against the assessment awaiting hearing. Based on legal advice management believes that the defence against the assessment will be successful. Although liability is not admitted but because of uncertainty, a full provision has been made.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).

In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: \u2022 select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently; \u2022 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; \u2022 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and \u2022 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business. The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). In our opinion the financial statements: \u2022 give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2020 and of its profit for the year then ended; \u2022 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and \u2022 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC\u2019s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: \u2022 the directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or \u2022 the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the company\u2019s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Other information The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor\u2019s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

Page 7 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of United Wholesale Grocers Limited We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities [set out on page 6 ], the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK), we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: \u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control. \u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. \u2022 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. \u2022 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and",

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result. Tax The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income. Page 13 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the financial statements. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference. Tangible assets Tangible fixed assets under the cost model, other than investment properties, are stated in the statement of financial position at historical cost, except use of GAAP value of land and buildings on 1 January 2014 as deemed cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation. Depreciation Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Asset class Depreciation method and rate Freehold buildings 50 years Plant, fixtures and fittings 5 to 7 years Motor Vehicles 5 years Freehold Land Freehold land is not depreciated. Investment property Investment property is carried at fair value, derived from the current market prices for comparable real estate determined annually by the directors. The fair value is determined by the directors based on the current estimated market rent value using observable market prices, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Trade debtors Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.

Page 14 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Trade creditors Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the company has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of their fair value at inception of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis. Dividends Dividend distribution to the company\u2019s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the reporting period in which the dividends are declared. Defined contribution pension obligation The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

Page 15 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 Financial instruments Classification Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Recognition and measurement Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade payables or receivables, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration, expected to be paid or received. However if the arrangement of a short-term instrument constitute a financing transaction, like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate or in case of an out-right short-term loan not at a market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially at the present value of the future cash flow discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument and subsequently at a amortised cost. Financial asset that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Income. For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is current effective interest rate determined under the contract. For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate, which is an approximation of the amount that the Company would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the balance sheet date. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously Page 16 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. In preparing these financial statements, the directors have made the following judgements: Tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties, are depreciated over their useful lives taking into account residual values, where appropriate. The actual lives of the assets and residual values are",

Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. In preparing these financial statements, the directors have made the following judgements: Tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties, are depreciated over their useful lives taking into account residual values, where appropriate. The actual lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors. In re-assessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account. Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the asset and projected disposal values. Investment properties are valued each year. The directors consider market conditions and the value of similar property in deciding a fair value. Bad debts are provided for where objective evidence of the need for a provision exists. Stocks are assessed for evidence of obsolescence and a provision is made against any inventory unlikely to be sold. Cost of Sales Cost of sales represents all costs incurred, net of supplier rebates (see below), up to the point of sale including the operating expenses of the trading outlets. 3 Revenue The analysis of the company's revenue for the year from continuing operations is as follows: 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 Sale of goods 215,847,481 167,438,677 Rental income from investment property 77,110 111,717 Other revenue 28,780 21,168 215,953,371 167,571,562 The analysis of the company's turnover for the year by market is as follows: 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 UK 215,087,141 167,571,562 Europe 694,413 - Rest of world 171,817 - 215,953,371 167,571,562 Page 17 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 4 Other operating income The analysis of the company's other operating income for the year is as follows: 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 Job retention scheme grant 30,290 - 5 Operating profit Arrived at after charging/(crediting) 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 Depreciation expense 250,488 253,993 Operating lease expense - plant and machinery 138,055 132,823 6 Other interest receivable and similar income 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 Interest income on bank deposits 20,107 27,281 Other finance income 48,872 91,041 68,979 118,322 7 Interest payable and similar expenses 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 Hire purchase interest 1,620 1,620 Page 18 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 8 Staff costs The aggregate payroll costs (including directors' remuneration) were as follows: 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 Wages and salaries 3,929,847 3,740,953 Social security costs 321,564 295,563 Pension costs, defined contribution scheme 66,416 60,268 4,317,827 4,096,784 The average number of persons employed by the company (including directors) during the year, analysed by category was as follows: 2020 No. 2019 No. Administration and support 62 52 Sales, marketing and distribution 143 138 205 190 9 Directors' remuneration The directors' remuneration for the year was as follows: 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 Remuneration 87,750 88,250 10 Auditors' remuneration 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 Audit of the financial statements 19,000 16,500 Other fees to auditors Taxation compliance services 4,000 2,500 All other assurance services 11,000 3,000 15,000 5,500 Page 19 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 11 Taxation Tax charged/(credited) in the income statement 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 Current taxation UK corporation tax 2,020,708 606,247 UK corporation tax adjustment to prior periods ( 52,509 ) ( 10,589 ) 1,968,199 595,658 Deferred taxation Arising from write-down or reversal of write-down of deferred tax asset ( 33,220 )",

Excise duty In 2013 the company purchased certain goods from a supplier at a market price inclusive of excise duty. HM Revenue and Customs allege that the UK duty on the goods was not paid by the defaulting/missing trader or supplier, therefore any person involved in the holding of the excise goods is jointly and severally liable to pay the duty. Hence HM Revenue & Customs has raised an assessment for unpaid duty amounting to \u00a3713,992. The company lodged an appeal against the assessment awaiting hearing. Based on legal advice management believes that the defence against the assessment will be successful. Although liability is not admitted but because of uncertainty, a full provision has been made. 19 Pension and other schemes Defined contribution pension scheme The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The pension cost charge for the year represents contributions payable by the company to the scheme and amounted to \u00a3 66,416 (2019 - \u00a3 60,268 ) . 20 Share capital Allotted, called up and fully paid shares 2020 2019 No. \u00a3 No. \u00a3 Ordinary shares of \u00a31 each of \u00a3 1 each 5,500 5,500 5,500 5,500 21 Loans and borrowings 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 Non-current loans and borrowings Finance lease liabilities - 5,286 Page 24 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2020 2020 \u00a3 2019 \u00a3 Current loans and borrowings Finance lease liabilities 6,012 9,546 The bank loan and overdraft of a fellow subsidiary are secured by a floating charge over the assets and undertakings of the company and cross guarantees between the company and the parent company and other subsidiaries and by standard security over land and buildings owned by the company and fellow subsidiaries.

Approved by the Board on 29 December 2020 on its behalf by: A Ramzan Director Page 4 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Statement of Directors' Responsibilities The directors acknowledge their responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: \u2022 select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently; \u2022 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; \u2022 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and \u2022 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business. The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

This report is made solely to the company\u2019s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company\u2019s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor\u2019s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company\u2019s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. In our opinion the financial statements: \u2022 give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2019 and of its profit for the year then ended; \u2022 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and \u2022 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC\u2019s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: \u2022 the directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or \u2022 the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the company\u2019s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Other information The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor\u2019s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Page 6 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of United Wholesale Grocers Limited In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this",

      "text": "audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: \u2022 the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and \u2022 the Strategic Report and Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. Matters on which we are required to report by exception In the light of our knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report. We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: \u2022 adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or \u2022 the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or \u2022 certain disclosures of directors\u2019 remuneration specified by law are not made; or \u2022 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities [set out on page 5 ], the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Page 7 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of United Wholesale Grocers Limited As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK), we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.

We also: \u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control. \u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. \u2022 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. \u2022 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \u2022 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the company to express an opinion on the financial statements.

Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Company financial statements. Revenue recognition Turnover comprises revenue recognised when goods are received by the customers and risks and rewards of ownership passed to them. Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services net of Value Added Tax and trade discounts. Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result. Tax The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except that a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income. Page 12 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between taxable profits and profits reported in the financial statements. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference. Tangible assets Tangible fixed assets under the cost model, other than investment properties, are stated in the statement of financial position at historical cost, except use of GAAP value of land and buildings on 1 January 2014 as deemed cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation. Depreciation Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Asset class Depreciation method and rate Freehold buildings 50 years Plant, fixtures and fittings 5 to 7 years Motor Vehicles 5 years Freehold Land Freehold land is not depreciated. Investment property Investment property is carried at fair value, derived from the current market prices for comparable real estate determined annually by the directors. The fair value is determined by the directors based on the current estimated market rent value using observable market prices, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Trade debtors Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction",

Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Trade debtors Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Page 13 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Trade creditors Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of the reporting period, to defer settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the company has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event, it is probable that the company will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of their fair value at inception of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.

Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis. Dividends Dividend distribution to the company\u2019s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the reporting period in which the dividends are declared. Defined contribution pension obligation The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate. Page 14 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 Financial instruments Classification Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Recognition and measurement Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans and other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade payables or receivables, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration, expected to be paid or received. However if the arrangement of a short-term instrument constitute a financing transaction, like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate or in case of an out-right short-term loan not at a market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially at the present value of the future cash flow discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument and subsequently at a amortised cost. Financial asset that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Income. For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is current effective interest rate determined under the contract. For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate, which is an approximation of the amount that the Company would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the balance sheet date. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously Page 15 United Wholesale Grocers Limited Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the",

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. In preparing these financial statements, the directors have made the following judgements: Tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties, are depreciated over their useful lives taking into account residual values, where appropriate. The actual lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors. In re-assessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account. Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the asset and projected disposal values. Investment properties are valued each year.

Excise duty In 2013 the company purchased certain goods from a supplier at a market price inclusive of excise duty. HM Revenue and Customs allege that the UK duty on the goods was not paid by the defaulting/missing trader or supplier, therefore any person involved in the holding of the excise goods is jointly and severally liable to pay the duty. Hence HM Revenue & Customs has raised an assessment for unpaid duty amounting to \u00a3713,992. The company lodged an appeal against the assessment awaiting hearing. Based on legal advice management believes that the defence against the assessment will be successful. Although liability is not admitted but because of uncertainty, a full provision has been made.
