    **Strategic Counsel (SC)** is an advanced AI-powered workspace prototype, meticulously engineered to
    serve as an intelligent partner for legal, financial, and strategic professionals. Its core purpose is to
    facilitate **AI-assisted drafting, in-depth research, and nuanced strategic exploration**.

    SC achieves this by integrating sophisticated AI models with a powerful context injection system,
    allowing users to leverage bespoke protocols, matter-specific documents, web-based information, and curated
    memories to guide and inform the AI. Specialized tools, such as the UK Companies House analysis module,
    further augment these capabilities by providing structured data and insights.

    The application is designed with a focus on modularity, efficiency, and empowering users to derive
    actionable intelligence from complex information landscapes.

    For a practical guide to each feature, see the **Instructions** tab.

    *Disclaimer: This application is currently a demonstration and development prototype. It should not be
    used for making real-world legal or financial decisions without independent verification by qualified
    professionals. All data processing and AI outputs are subject to the inherent limitations of the
    underlying models and data sources.*

    st.markdown("""
    - **Intelligence Augmentation:** SC aims to be a 'cognitive partner,' enhancing the user's ability to draft,
      research, analyze, and strategize more effectively, rather than replacing human expertise.
    - **Context is Key:** The system's primary strength lies in its ability to maintain and inject relevant context
      (session digests, document summaries, web links, user-defined memories, and operational protocols)
      into AI interactions, leading to highly pertinent and tailored outputs.
    - **Strategic Exploration:** Provide a flexible environment for users to explore complex scenarios, test hypotheses,
      and generate diverse strategic options with AI assistance.
    - **Modularity & Maintainability:** The codebase is structured into distinct, manageable modules for
      easier development, testing, and future enhancements.
    - **Transparency & Control:** Users are provided with insights into the AI models being used, cost
      estimations (where applicable), and options to control aspects like data injection and specialized tool usage.
    - **Objective Analysis (for specialized tools):** When employing data-specific tools like the Companies House analyzer,
      the AI summarization prompts are designed to enforce rigorous, objective, and factual extraction of information.

        The heart of Strategic Counsel lies in its 'Consult Counsel' tab, providing an interactive environment for:
        - **AI-Powered Drafting:** Generate initial drafts, refine existing text, create summaries, or formulate responses based on complex instructions and injected context.
        - **In-Depth Research Assistance:** Leverage AI to process and synthesize information from provided documents, URLs, and internal knowledge bases (memories/digests) to answer questions or identify key insights.
        - **Strategic Exploration & Scenario Planning:** Use the AI as a sounding board to explore different strategic avenues, analyze potential outcomes, and identify risks or opportunities based on the provided context.
        - **Protocol-Driven Behavior:** A master "protocol" file (`strategic_protocols.txt`) guides the AI's persona, tone, analytical framework, and primary objectives, ensuring its responses align with professional standards and user needs.
        - **Dynamic Context Injection:** This is crucial. Users can dynamically select and inject various information sources into the AI's working memory for each interaction:
            - **Session Digest:** A running, AI-updated summary of the current matter/topic.
            - **User-Defined Memories:** Persistent, topic-specific snippets of key facts, instructions, or client preferences.
            - **Uploaded Documents & Summaries:** Textual content and AI-generated summaries from PDFs, DOCX, TXT files.
            - **Web Links:** Content extracted and summarized from provided URLs.
        This rich contextual grounding ensures AI outputs are highly relevant, tailored, and directly applicable to the user's specific task and matter.

            - Displayed for quick review.
